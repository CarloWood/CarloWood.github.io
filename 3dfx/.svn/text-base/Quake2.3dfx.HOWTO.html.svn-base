<H3>Things you need to download</H3>
<P>Start with installing the 3dfx.o kernel module by installing <TT><A HREF="Device3Dfx-2.3-5.src.rpm">Device3Dfx-2.3-5.src.rpm</A></TT>.</P>

<P>Then have the following rpms installed, either the libc5 versions:

<H1>[Latest update: I don't use Glide anymore.  Instead I use the drivers
from <A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/Products/Drivers.nsf/Linux.html">NVIDIA</A>.]</H1>

</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.50cm"><A HREF="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/oldsite/3DfxRPMS_old.html">Glide_V2-2.53-1.i386.rpm</A> and quake2-3.19a-2.i386.rpm or quake2-3.20beta-5.i386.rpm</PRE>
<P>
*or* the glibc versions: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.50cm"><A HREF="http://glide.xxedgexx.com/oldsite/3DfxRPMS_old.html">Glide_V2-2.53-1.i386.glibc.rpm</A> and quake2-3.19a-glibc-2.i386.rpm or quake2-3.20beta-glibc-5.i386.rpm</PRE>
<P>
Note that the quake2-*.i386.rpm's install in /usr/local/games/quake2,
you might want to add a symbolic link _before_ installing the rpms. 
</P>
<P>After installing the quake2*rpm change directory to
/usr/local/games/quake2 and type: 
</P>
<PRE>tar cf - lib*GL* | (cd /usr/lib; tar xf -)
chmod 755 quake2</PRE>
<P>
The latter is needed because otherwise something goes wrong with the
loading of the needed shared libraries. When an executable is suid
root, all LD_* environment variables are ignored. You don't need it
to be suid anyway because we'll use /dev/3dfx. Of course, the
software renderer won't work anymore now, unless you run it as root.
The <TT>tar</TT> will put the Mesa lib in /usr/lib, it needs to be
there because it won't load otherwise. Don't worry about using
Mesa-3.0, because we won't use the Mesa lib for anything else but
prohibiting unresolved variables anyway: We use the 3DFX OpenGL
Miniport. 
</P>
<P>If you use quake2-3.19a-2.i386.rpm then you need a symbolic link
from /usr/lib/libMesaGL.so.2 to lib3dfxgl.so. For instance, if you
have installed quake2 in /usr/bulk/games/quake2/ then do: 
</P>
<PRE>     cd /usr/lib
     rm libMesaGL.so.2
     ln -s ../bulk/games/quake2/lib3dfxgl.so libMesaGL.so.2</PRE>
<P>
Don't do this if you don't use quake2-3.19a-2.i386.rpm (but one of
the other three mentioned quake2*rpm's). 
</P>
<H3>Connecting to a game server</H3>
<P>Quake2 has problems to connect to a game server with a different
mod. There is a work around for this however: In order to connect to
a game server, you need to specify the mod of that server on the
commandline. 
</P>
<P>For instance, if you want to connect to a <I>lithium</I> server,
then use: 
</P>
<P>q2 +set game lithium +connect &lt;quake2.server.addr&gt; 
</P>
<H3>Kernel 2.1.131 and sound</H3>
<P>There is a bug in quake that makes sound not work on some PCI
machines (maybe others?) and the way sound was changed in the newer
kernels. If you hear a terrible noise when starting quake then try
out Alan Cox's <A HREF="ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.1/patch-2.1.131-ac4.gz">patch-2.1.131-ac4.gz</A>.
You might also want to uncomment the &quot;SMP = 1&quot; in
/usr/src/linux/Makefile, it might be related. (Note: It is known that
sound is broken in at least 2.1.126, and not in 2.1.115. Alan's patch
works for me however, I am running 2.1.131.ac4 as I type (and Quake +
sound works ;)).</P>
<H3>Other important issues</H3>
<P>Make sure that:

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.00cm">If you run a 2.1 kernel and you
	have a Pentium Pro or Pentium II system, and you don't already see a
	/proc/mtrr, then recompile your kernel to support it (answer Yes to
	`Prompt for incomplete drivers' and then Yes to CONFIG_MTRR). The
	Dev3Dfx contains code to set the MTRR on a system with a 2.0 kernel
	too, but you won't be able to check if it worked (with `cat
	/proc/mtrr', after loading the 3dfx.o module)
