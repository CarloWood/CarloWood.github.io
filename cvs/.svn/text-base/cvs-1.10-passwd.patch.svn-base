  access to @sc{cvs} allows people to gain more general
  access to the system; no one has done a careful audit.
  
! Note that because the @file{$CVSROOT/CVSROOT} directory
! contains @file{passwd} and other files which are used
! to check security, you must control the permissions on
! this directory as tightly as the permissions on
! @file{/etc}.  The same applies to the @file{$CVSROOT}
! directory itself and any directory
! above it in the tree.  Anyone who has write access to
! such a directory will have the ability to become any
! user on the system.  Note that these permissions are
! typically tighter than you would use if you are not
! using pserver.
! @c TODO: Would be really nice to document/implement a
! @c scheme where the CVS server can run as some non-root
! @c user, e.g. "cvs".  CVSROOT/passwd would contain a
! @c bunch of entries of the form foo:xxx:cvs (or the "cvs"
! @c would be implicit).  This would greatly reduce
! @c security risks such as those hinted at in the
! @c previous paragraph.  I think minor changes to CVS
! @c might be required but mostly this would just need
! @c someone who wants to play with it, document it, &c.
! 
! In summary, anyone who gets the password gets
! repository access, and some measure of general system
! access as well.  The password is available to anyone
! who can sniff network packets or read a protected
! (i.e., user read-only) file.  If you want real
! security, get Kerberos.
