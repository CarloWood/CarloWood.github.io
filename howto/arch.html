<h2>Finding things</h2>

<p>If you want to find something, there are several
classes of objects that you can start with.
Click on the link describing what you already have.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#packages">Packages</a>
<p>These are the archlinux packages. They have a <em>name</em>.
<li><a href="#package files">Package files</a>
  <p>These are the <code><em>name</em>-<em>version</em>-<em>arch</em>.pkg.tar.xz</code> files that contain a package.
The first part of the file name is usually the package <em>name</em>.
<li><a href="#sources">Sources</a>
<p>A git source tree containing a PKGBUILD file.</p>
<li><a href="#installed">Installed Files</a>
<p>Any file that was installed and is part of an Arch package.</p>
<li><a href="#apt-file">Other files</a>
<p>Files that are not yet installed.</p>
<li><a href="#apt-cache">Some keyword</a>
<p>If you look for a packages related to some keyword.</p>
</ul>

<a name="packages">
<h3>Packages</h3>

<p>When looking for information, you normally first want to find
the <b>package name</b>.</p>

<p>Here is how to <b>list all packages</b> that are installed:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Q
</pre>

<p>The package <em>names</em> are listed in the first column.
The second column is the version.</p>

<p>If the package name is already known, one can get the installed
version for a single package by running:</p>

<pre>
dpkg -Q <i>name</i>
</pre>

<p>Options that can be added to Q are:
<ul>
<li>c : View the ChangeLog of a package if it exists.
<li>d : Restrict or filter output to packages installed as dependencies.
        This option can be combined with -t for listing real orphans -
        packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer
        required by any installed package.
<li>e : Restrict or filter output to explicitly installed packages.
        This option can be combined with -t to list explicitly installed
        packages that are not required by any other package.
<li>g : Display all packages that are members of a named group.
        If a name is not specified, list all grouped packages.
<li>i : Display information on a given package.
        The -p option can be used if querying a package file instead of the local database.
        Passing two --info or -i flags will also display the list of backup files and their modification states.
<li>k : Check that all files owned by the given package(s) are present on the system.
        Specifying this option twice will perform more detailed file checking
        (including permissions, file sizes, and modification times) for
        packages that contain the needed mtree file.
<li>l : List all files owned by a given package.
<li>m : Restrict or filter output to packages that were not found in the sync database(s).
        Typically these are packages that were downloaded manually and installed with --upgrade.
<li>n : Restrict or filter output to packages that are found in the sync
        database(s). This is the inverse filter of --foreign.
<li>p : Signifies that the package supplied on the command line is a file and not an entry in the database.
<li>t : Restrict or filter output to print only packages neither required nor optionally required by any
        currently installed package. Specify this option twice to include packages which are optionally, but not
        directly, required by another package.
<li>u : Restrict or filter output to packages that are out-of-date on the local system.
        Only package versions are used to find outdated packages; replacements are not checked here.
        This option works best if the sync database is refreshed using -Sy.
</ul></p>

<a name="package files">
<h3>Package files</h3>

<p>These are <code><em>name</em>-<em>version</em>-<em>arch</em>.pkg.tar.xz</code>
files that contain a package. The first part of the file name up till the first dash
is usually the package name.</p>

<p>Information about a package file can be obtained with the command:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qi -p <i>name-version-arch</i>.pkg.tar.xz
</pre>

<p>This should extract the <em>name</em> of this package:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qi -p <i>package.pkg.tar.xz</i> | grep '^Name  *: ' | sed -e 's/Name  *: //'
</pre>

<a name="sources">
<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>Sources are normally not installed. You can only install
them if you know the package name. When checking out the
git repository of an arch package, a file named PKGBUILD
is downloaded that will contain the name of the package
in its content (after the <code>pkgname=</code> keyword).</p>

<a name="installed">
<h3>Installed files</h3>

<p>If you have a file <code>/path/filename</code> installed, and you
want to know what package it belongs to (if any), then issue the
following command:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qo /path/filename
</pre>

<p>This will print <code>/path/filename is owned by <em>name</em> <em>version</em></code>.</p>

<p>The path can be relative or absolute, and one or more files can be specified.</p>

<p>To search for regular expressions matching filenames (or descriptions)
one can use: <code>pacman -Qs &lt;regexp&gt;</code>. When including multiple search terms,
only packages with descriptions matching ALL of those terms are returned.</p>

<p>The command can therefore also used to search in a fuzzy way for packages
that have files installed matching the given pattern. It does however not
find/return extra files created by maintainer scripts, nor will it list
alternatives. You can therefore not conclude that it is safe to delete
a file if <code>pacman -Qs</code> doesn't return any packages.</p>

<a name="apt-file">
<h3>Other files</h3>

<p>In order to find packages that contain file patterns that you do not
have installed, you need <code>pacman -F</code></p>.

<p>You need to regularly synchronize its database by running,</p>

<pre>
sudo pacman -Fy
</pre>

<p>Then, search for the filename using,</p>

<pre>
pacman -F <i>/path/filename</i>
</pre>

or

<pre>
pacman -Fx <i><em>reg.exp</em></i>
</pre>

<p>will give you a list of packages containing <em>files</em> matching <i>reg.exp</i>.</p>

<p>Note that it will NOT list manually installed packages (aka, from AUR)!
For installed files you should use <code>pacman -Qo path</code> anyway.</p>

<a name="apt-cache">
<h3>Some keyword</h3>

<p>...to do...</p>

<a name="queries">
<h2>Queries</h2>

<p>Now you have the package <i>name</i>, you can query the package database
about it.</p>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>To print a list of all installed files (again excluding extra files
as generated by maintainer script or alternatives), issue the command:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Ql <i>name</i>
</pre>

<p>You can also use this command to find out if a package with that
exact name is installed at all (or use just <code>pacman -Q <i>name</i></code>.</p>

<p>Or, if you have a package file that isn't installed yet, you can list
its contents with</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qlp <i>package.tar.xz</i>
</pre>

<h3>Version</h3>

<p>To print the version of
of an <em>installed</em> package, type</p>

<pre>
pacman -Q <i>name</i>
</pre>

<h3>Everything</h3>

<p>More information about an installed package can be obtained
with the command:</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qi <i>name</i>
</pre>

<p>Or, if the package isn't installed yet</p>

<pre>
pacman -Qip <i>package.pkg.tar.xz</i>
</pre>

<a name="get">
<h3>Getting the source</h3>

<p>To work with Archlinux source packages, do as root:</p>

<pre>
pacman ... build essentials?
</pre>

<p>Often, a single source package generates multiple binary packages.
In order to find the name of the source that belongs to some package,
use <code>pacman ???</code>. For example,</p>

<pre>
pacman -??? <i>name</i>
</pre>

<p>should print the source name of the package.</p>

<p>This name can then be used to download the sources with
the command:</p>

<pre>
??? <i>name</i>
</pre>

<a name="build">
<h3>Building from source</h3>

<p>In order to build a package, execute once as root:</p>
