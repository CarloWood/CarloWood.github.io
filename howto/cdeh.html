<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page describes how to set up <em>cdeh</em>, a set of
scripts to automatically switch history and environment
(environment variables, functions and aliases) as function of the directory (tree)
that you are in.</p>

<p>If, like me, you like working from the command line, and you
are using <code>bash</code> as your SHELL, then this is for you.</p>

<p>The type of commands someone gives often depend on the
current working directory. Going up through the command line
history, it is annoying having to search for the last time
you gave that particular command when, in fact, it was probably
the last command you gave in a terminal window on that prompt.
Also, if you close a terminal, open a new one and change directory
back to where you were - you don't want to suddenly have your
command history cluttered with unrelated commands.</p>

<p>Especially when you are a developer who works from the command line,
like me, it turns out to be very productive to automatically switch
environment variables and aliases as function of the project directory
that you are in. This makes it possible to create simple aliases for
repetive commands that are nearly the same in every project.
For example, I configure <em>every</em> project by typing
<code>configure</code>; the real command that is executed then depends
on the directory I am in. If I am in
<code>~/projects/edragon/edragon-objdir</code> then the actual command is
<code>../edragon/configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/install/4.1.2-20061115 --disable-pch</code>,
while if I am in <code>~/projects/libecc/libecc-objdir</code> then
the actual command is
<code>../libecc/configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-optimization --enable-debug --prefix=/usr/local/install/4.1.2-20061115</code>.
Because these commands seldom change while in the same directory, it is
convenient to have a simple alias for them that is a function of the
directory that I am in.</p>

<a name="how">
<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>The switching is linked to the command prompt: whenever a command line
prompt is displayed, the current directory is checked and history/environment
switching is performed when necessary. This is achieved through the
use of the bash environment variable <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code>.</p>

<p>The actual history switching is done by changing the bash environment
variable that controls the history: <code>HISTFILE</code>.
You are free to use the other <code>HIST*</code>
environment variables (<code>man bash</code>). The environment variables
<code>HISTSIZE</code> and <code>HISTFILESIZE</code> are also used, but
if you set them prior to initialization of cdeh, then their values are
used.</p>

<p>The environment is changed by sourcing any files in your directory tree
that have the name <code>env.source</code>, starting with the file closest
to the root of the file system.
These files may contain whatever you want.
Personally, I use a system to facilitate different C++ projects in different
directories, dictating some mandatory content of <code>env.source</code>,
but that is basically independent of how <em>cdeh</em> works and is therefore
described seperately at the end of this document.</p>

<a name="download">
<h2>Downloading and setting up cdeh</h2>

<p>The <em>cdeh</em> system consists of three system wide files, although
it is possible to install them in your home directory if you don't
have root.</p>

<p>There are three system wide files. Normally, the environment variable
<code>CDEH_ROOT</code> should be set system wide, and the two
files <a href="do_prompt">do_prompt</a> and <a href="env.bashrc">env.bashrc</a>
should be installed in <code>CDEH_ROOT</code>.
I also have <code>addhistory</code> (see below) installed in
<code>CDEH_ROOT</code>, and keep a symbolic link from
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> to it.
The directory <code>$CDEH_ROOT/history</code> should exist,
be owned by root and mode 1777. If you don't have root, then
it should exist, be owned by you and be mode 700.
For example,

<pre>
&gt; cd $CDEH_ROOT
&gt; ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    93 2007-05-25 17:04 <a href="addhistory">addhistory</a>*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  3676 2018-02-16 16:31 <a href="do_prompt">do_prompt</a>*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  6477 2018-02-16 17:24 <a href="env.bashrc">env.bashrc</a>
drwxrwxrwt 4 root root  4096 2018-02-14 15:52 history/
</pre>

<p>The latter needs to be sourced from, for example,
your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file. You can do this by adding the following
line at the <em>very bottom</em> of your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file:</p>

<pre>
#CDEH_VERBOSE=1                 # Set this to get more stuff printed.
HISTSIZE=1200                   # Example, the default is 1000.
CDEH_ROOT=/encrypted/cdeh       # Or define this globally.
source $CDEH_ROOT/env.bashrc
</pre>

<p>By picking an encrypted partition for <code>CDEH_ROOT</code>,
all history files will be encrypted. This is the reason that the
history files aren't stored in the users home directory by default
(which might not be encrypted).</p>

<p>The PROMPT_COMMAND will now source all <code>env.source</code>
files in your working directory path, starting with file with the shortest
path. For example, if there exist <code>/opt/env.source</code>,
<code>/opt/projects/cdeh/env.source</code> and <code>/opt/projects/cdeh/test/env.source</code>
and you cd into the directory <code>/opt/projects/cdeh/test/a/b</code>
then first <code>/opt/env.source</code> will be sourced, followed
by <code>/opt/projects/cdeh/env.source</code> and finally <code>/opt/projects/cdeh/test/env.source</code>.</p>

<p>The small script <a href="addhistory">addhistory</a> should be installed
somewhere in your <code>PATH</code>, or in <code>CDEH_ROOT</code>
(to keep everything together) using for example a symlink from
<code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>

<p>Running <code>addhistory</code> inside any
directory will start a new history file for that directory and all
of its subdirectories (that do not already have their own history file).</p>

<a name="details">
<h2>Detailed description</h2>

<h3>env.bashrc</h3>

<p>The following environment variables are set:
<ul>
<li><code><b>CDEH_HISTSIZE</b></code> is set to <code>HISTSIZE</code> or,
if that wasn't defined, to 1000.
Subsequentially, <code><b>HISTSIZE</b></code> is reset to
<code>CDEH_HISTSIZE</code> every time <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> is
executed. Thus, if you wish to use a particular <code>HISTSIZE</code>,
you have to set it <em>before</em> sourcing
<code>env.bashrc</code> &mdash;
or, you can change <code>CDEH_HISTSIZE</code> afterwards.
<li>If <code><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></code> isn't already set at the moment that
<code>env.bashrc</code> is sourced, or when its
value is less than <code>CDEH_HISTSIZE</code>, then it is set to the
same value as <code>CDEH_HISTSIZE</code>.
<li><code><b>CDEH_USER</b></code> is set to <code>"`/usr/bin/whoami`"</code>.
It should be possible to use this as a directory name. It is used
in the path of other files in order to allow the use of this
system by more than one user. The reason that those files aren't stored
in the users home directories is that I want to allow the use of
an encrypted partition for the history files, and the users home directory
doesn't need to be encrypted.
<li><code><b>CDEH_HISTROOT</b></code> is set to the base path for the history
files of this user: <code>$CDEH_ROOT/history/$CDEH_USER</code>.
<li><code><b>CDEH_TMP</b></code> is set to a uniq path in /tmp for temporary
files.
<li>A <code>function</code> <code><b>exit</b></code> is defined, overriding
the normal 'exit'. This is done to assure that the history is written
when you exit the shell, and to cleanup temporary files from <code>/tmp</code>.
<li>A <code>function</code> <code><b>resource</b></code> is defined; you can run
this reread (possibly altered) <code>env.source</code> files without
changing directory.
<li>The <code>functions</code> <code><b>no_path</b></code>, <code><b>add_path</b></code>, <code><b>pre_path</b></code> and <code><b>del_path</b></code> are
defined which allow you to manipulate colon seperated directory lists like <code>PATH</code>.
<li>If <code><b>TOPPROJECT</b></code> is not set, it is set to <code>DEFAULT_TOPPROJECT</code>.
<li><code><b>PROMPT_COMMAND</b></code> is initialized.
<li><code><b>CDEH_STORE_ENVIRONMENT</b></code> is set to <code>"yes"</code> so that on the first
invocation of <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> the current environment is saved to <code>$CDEH_TMP/env.base</code>.
This is why sourcing <code>env.bashrc</code> must occur at the very end of your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>do_prompt</h3>

<p>This is the main script, executed from <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code>.
There is little to edit in this file, although you might need to be
aware of the fact that it starts with setting <code>CDEH_TMP</code>
again. This should be the <em>same</em> path as is being used in
<code>env.bashrc</code> of course.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the following points probably need your attention:
<ul>
<li>In case the directory <code>CDEH_HISTROOT</code> doesn't exist,
the script will print (every prompt) a warning. Since cdeh only runs
every prompt and doesn't keep a record of what warnings it sent before,
you might get error or warning messages <em>every</em> prompt. Don't
let that scare you off; just fix the problem.
<li>This script also tries to change the title of the current terminal
window into something that reflects both, the current working directory
as well as the history root path.
It does this by calling <code>xtermset</code>, so you want to have
that installed (it is probably part of the package <em>xtermset</em>.
On ubuntu/debian: <code>apt-get install xtermset</code>).
<li>In order not to be confused by symbolic links, the script uses
the inodes of directories to know if it changed directory or not.
These inodes are retieved by calling <code>stat</code> (package: coreuitls)
and <code>awk</code> (package: gawk), both of which need to be in your
<code>PATH</code>.
</ul>
</p>

<a name="env.source">
<h2>Example: A system for environment switching</h2>

<p><li>In project directories (like <code>/home/carlo/projects/ircproxy</code>)
I have the project specific <code>env.source</code> file, and a
<code>env.compiler</code> file. The latter determines which compiler to use
when this project is the current/main project. Even library project
directories have their own <code>env.compiler</code> file, because I can
be working on them, without having a relationship with any other particular
project. The <code>env.compiler</code> file defines the environment variables
<code>CC</code>, <code>CXX</code>, <code>CPP</code> and <code>CXXCPP</code>.
For example (to use the default compilers),
<pre>
CC="gcc"
CXX="g++"

export CC CXX
</pre>
while in another project I use a more complex definition that uses two PCs,
doing distributed compilation (which, unfortunately doesn't really speed
up the compilation process with only two PC's):
<pre>
CC="pcc"
CXX="pc++"
CC0="/usr/bin/gcc"
CXX0="/usr/bin/g++"
CC1="/home/carlo/bin/ansset-gcc"
CXX1="/home/carlo/bin/ansset-g++"
CC2="/usr/bin/gcc"
CXX2="/usr/bin/g++"
CC3="/home/carlo/bin/ansset-gcc"
CXX3="/home/carlo/bin/ansset-g++"

export CC CXX CC0 CXX0 CC1 CXX1 CC2 CXX2 CC3 CXX3
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>ansset-gcc</code> and <code>ansset-g++</code> are
scripts that further do work to actually use the compiler on another
machine (but that is not relevant for this document).</p>
<p>I have a lot of different compiler versions installed in
<code>/usr/local</code>.
Some projects use a particular version (for example for testing libraries),
which could need a <code>env.compiler</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre>
CC=gcc-4.0.3
CXX=g++-4.0.3
CPP="/usr/local/$CC/bin/cpp"
CXXCPP="/usr/local/$CC/bin/cpp -x c++"

export CC CXX
export CPP CXXCPP
</pre>
<li>Each projects (root) directory gets an <code>env.source</code>
that defines several "standard" environment variables and aliases.
<ul>
<li>REPOBASE &mdash; The projects root directory.
<li>TOPPROJECT &mdash; This environment variable is only set
for standalone projects. Library projects usually don't define this.
<li>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME &mdash; Set to the identity to use for that project.
<li>CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS &mdash; Whatever is appropriate
to use for this project. These environment variables are usually used
by <em>configure</em> and/or the Makefile.
<li>CCACHE_DIR &mdash; All my non-standard compilers (installed with
<code>--prefix=/usr/local/gcc-$COMPILER_VERSION</code>) are <em>actually</em>
<a href="gcc_or_g++-version">scripts</a>,
which use ccache when this environment variable is set.
<li>INSTALL_PREFIX &mdash; The install prefix used to configure the project.
This is dependend on the compiler version, so that libraries and applications
compiled with a specific compiler version will only use eachother (and
whatever is installed as part of the Operating System when the library is
not available in <code>INSTALL_PREFIX</code>).
<li>PKG_CONFIG_PATH &mdash; Used by <code>pkg-config(1)</code>, used in
many <code>./configure</code> scripts.
<li>PATH &mdash; Updated to include the <code>INSTALL_PREFIX</code>.
<li>LD_LIBRARY_PATH &mdash; Updated to include the <code>INSTALL_PREFIX</code>.
<li>CONFIGURE_OPTIONS &mdash; The default configure options to use for
this project.
<li>OUTPUT_DIRECTORY &mdash; Where <code>doxygen</code> has to write the
documentation to.
<li>CTAGS_ROOT_SRCDIRS &mdash; Additions source dirs for ctags that this
project should use. This is being used by some (standarized) entry in my
Makefiles.
</ul>
<p>The following aliases are defined:
<ul>
<li>s &mdash; This should print all source files of the project. It is
mainly used from the command line to <code>grep</code> all sources.
For example, to list all source files that use some class name
<code>ServerSession</code>, I'd type: <code>grep -l ServerSession `s`</code>
without being bothered by where all the source files of this particular
project are.
<li>vi &mdash; This alias is redefined in order to tell vim where the tag
files for this particular project can be found
(as generated with <code>ctags(1)</code>).
<li>syncwww &mdash; Whenever a project contains documentation, the alias
<code>syncwww</code> is defined to whatever command needs to be executed
to export this documentation, synchronizing the documentation of the
current project with the external (public) web pages. Again,
not bothering me anymore with project specific details.
</ul>
</p>
<p>The following functions are defined:
<ul>
<li>configure &mdash; usually,
<code>
configure ()
{
    pushd "$REPOBASE-objdir";
    $REPOBASE/configure $CONFIGURE_OPTIONS &amp;&amp; echo "Configured with $CONFIGURE_OPTIONS.";
    popd
}
</code>
<li>make &mdash; usually,
<code>
make () 
{ 
    CURDIR=$(pwd);
    CPUS=`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc --lines`;
    not_done=1;
    while [ $not_done -eq 1 ]; do
        not_done=0;
        case $1 in 
            -j)
                shift;
                CPUS=$1;
                shift;
                not_done=1
            ;;
            maintainer-clean)
                /usr/bin/make -C $REPOBASE-objdir maintainer-clean;
                cd $REPOBASE &amp;&amp; ./autogen.sh
            ;;
            ctags | tags)
                cd $REPOBASE-objdir &amp;&amp; ctags --language-force=C++ --regex-C++='/(^|[[:space:];{])using[[:space:]]+([[:alnum:]_]*)[[:space:]]*=/\2/' `s`
            ;;
            *)
                /usr/bin/make -C $REPOBASE-objdir -j $CPUS $@
            ;;
        esac;
    done;
    cd $CURDIR
}
</code>
</ul>
</p>
<p>As an example, the following is my <code>env.source</code> file
as used for my cwchessboard project:</p>
<pre>
  export TOPPROJECT=/home/carlo/projects/cwchessboard
  source $TOPPROJECT/env.compiler
  
  CPPFLAGS=
  LDFLAGS=
  CFLAGS=-g3
  CXXFLAGS=-g3
  
  export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS CFLAGS CXXFLAGS
  
  # These two are helper variables.
  GCCVER=`$CXX -v 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep '^gcc[ -][Vv]ersion' | sed -e 's/gcc[ -][Vv]ersion //' -e 's/ (.*//' -e 's/ /-/g'`
  INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local/install/$GCCVER"
  
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig"
  del_path .
  pre_path "$INSTALL_PREFIX/bin"
  pre_path .
  pre_path "$INSTALL_PREFIX/lib" LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH INSTALL_PREFIX
  
  alias s='ls $TOPPROJECT/cwchessboard/*.cc $TOPPROJECT/cwchessboard/*.h'
  alias vi='vim -c "set tags=$TOPPROJECT/cwchessboard-objdir/tags"'
  
  export CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--enable-maintainer-mode --enable-debug --prefix=$INSTALL_PREFIX"
  export OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=/home/carlo/www
  export CTAGS_ROOT_SRCDIRS="/usr/src/gtk/glib-current /usr/src/gtk/gtk+-current"
</pre>
<p>While a C++ <em>library</em> project, like <code>libcwd</code>,
does not set <code>TOPPROJECT</code>, it can
<em>use</em> <code>TOPPROJECT</code> to change, for instance, the
configure options.
This project also defines the alias <code>syncwww</code>:</p>

Where the shell functions configure and make are already defined
in a parent directory of this project.

Of course, these are just ideas. Use your creativity and write
env.source files that will make <em>your</em> life easier!
