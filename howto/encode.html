<h2>The recipe</h2>

<p>Suppose you have a large Matroska container (extension .mkv or .mka)
and you want to make a smaller version. For the sake of copying and pasting
command, I'll use environment variables. Let MKVFILE be the original
Matroska container:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
MKVFILE=&quot;the.matrix.revolutions.2003.dvd9.720p.hddvd.x264-hv.mkv&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The first step is to extract the audio.
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4.html#menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-audio">You don't want to touch the audio</a>,
so we'll leave it intact. However, we need to know it's size,
therefore we start with extracting it.</p>

<p>List all the tracks in Matroska container:<p>

<div class="command"><pre>
$ mkvmerge -i &quot;$MKVFILE&quot;
File 'the.matrix.revolutions.2003.dvd9.720p.hddvd.x264-hv.mkv': container: Matroska
Track ID 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)
Track ID 2: audio (A_AC3)
</pre></div>

<p>See the NOTES of <code>man mkvextract</code> for the meaning of
(A_AC3) and (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC).</p>

<p>The audio is in track 2, therefore extract track 2:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mkvextract tracks &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; 2:audio.ac3
</pre></div>

<p>Store the size in bytes in AUDIOSIZE:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
AUDIOSIZE=$(stat -c%s audio.ac3); echo $AUDIOSIZE
</pre></div>

<p>Next, we need to calculate new values for the resolution and bitrate.
In order to do so we need some information about the original file.</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mplayer -identify -v -frames 0 &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep '^\[mkv\]'
</pre></div>

<p>This should tell you the duration of the movie in seconds, the
frames per second of the video track, and the resolutie (Pixel width
and Pixel height). For example:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
$ mplayer -identify -v -frames 0 &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null | grep '^\[mkv\]' | \
    egrep 'duration|Track type: Video|Pixel width|Pixel height'
[mkv] | + duration: 7755.936s
[mkv] |  + Default duration: 32.000ms ( = 31.250 fps)
[mkv] |  + Track type: Video
[mkv] |  + Default duration: 41.708ms ( = 23.976 fps)
[mkv] |   + Pixel width: 1280
[mkv] |   + Pixel height: 528
</pre></div>

<p>Put those numbers in variables,<p>

<div class="command"><pre>
DURATION=7755.936
FPS=23.976024
MFPS=24000/1001
WIDTH=1280
HEIGHT=528
</pre></div>

<p>Note that I used 23.976024, because the real value is exactly 24000/1001.
The variable MFPS is set to this quotient with 1001 as divisor. See the
man page of mencoder for hints of valid possibilities.
Also note that 1280 and 528 are multiples of 16, in order to not waste
valuable bandwidth while encoding a movie, you want to keep it that way.</p>

<p>Lets make an estimate of the new resolution and bitrate.
In order to do that, we need the original average bitrate, which
is the original raw video stream size devided by the duration.
If you want to do this precisely, you'd have to execute the following
commands:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mkvextract tracks &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; 1:video.h264
VIDEOSIZE=$(stat -c%s video.h264)
</pre></div>

<p>But, if the audio and video track are the only two tracks,
you might as well just set</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
VIDEOSIZE=$(expr $(stat -c%s &quot;$MKVFILE&quot;) - $AUDIOSIZE); echo "$VIDEOSIZE bytes"
</pre></div>

<p>The original average bitrate in kbit/s is then,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
BITRATE=$(echo "scale=2; $VIDEOSIZE * 8 / $DURATION / 1000" | bc); echo "$BITRATE kbit/s"
</pre></div>

<p>Next we have to choose the target size. Lets say we want to put
the result on a single layered DVD, which can contain around 4.7 *
1,000,000,000 bytes. Due to extra bytes needed for ext2, I couldn't get more
than 4685697024 bytes on that. To play it safe, lets set the maximum target
file size to 4680000000. [ Be warned that if you really want to
write the result to a DVD, you cannot write files larger than 4GB
(4294967295) bytes on an iso9660 filesystem; You can still write the
large file as, for example, an ext2 filesystem image to the DVD,
of course. ]</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
MAXTARGETSIZE=4280000000        # Write image as iso9660 (can be used with K3B DVD data projects).
# OR, if you know what you're doing (do you know how to create a ext2 image?!)
MAXTARGETSIZE=4680000000	# Write image as ext2. You will only be able to mount/read this DVD on linux.
</pre></div>

<p>This means that our video target size is about,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
MAXVIDEOSIZE=$(expr $MAXTARGETSIZE - $AUDIOSIZE); echo "$MAXVIDEOSIZE bytes"
</pre></div>

<p>The new bitrate will then be something like,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
NEWBITRATE=$(echo "scale=6; tmp = $BITRATE * $MAXVIDEOSIZE / $VIDEOSIZE + 0.5; scale=0; tmp / 1" | bc)
echo "$NEWBITRATE kbit/s"
</pre></div>

<p>Following <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4.html#menc-feat-dvd-mpeg4-resolution-bitrate">this documentation</a>, 
we'll have the bitrate scale proportional to the square root of resolution,
hence <code>bitrate / sqrt(width * height) = constant</code>. This constant
is thus,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
RATIO=$(echo "scale=3; $BITRATE / sqrt ( $WIDTH * $HEIGHT )" | bc)
</pre></div>

<p>Furthermore, we want to keep the aspect ratio approximately the
same (not entirely, because we need to do some cropping in order to
end up with a resolution that is a multiple of 16 again). The approximate
target aspect ratio is thus,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
ASPECTRATIO=$(echo "scale=6; $WIDTH / $HEIGHT" | bc); echo $ASPECTRATIO
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can calculate the new height. Make sure it's a multiple of 16:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
NEWHEIGHT=$(echo "scale=6; tmp = $NEWBITRATE / ( $RATIO * sqrt( $ASPECTRATIO ) ); scale=0; (tmp + 8) / 16 * 16" | bc)
NEWWIDTH=$(echo "scale=6; tmp = $NEWHEIGHT * $ASPECTRATIO; scale=0; tmp / 16 * 16" | bc)
echo "$NEWWIDTH x $NEWHEIGHT"
</pre></div>

<p>Because this changed the aspect ratio, we calculate how much pixels we need
to crop the width of the original to get the same aspect ratio again:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
NEWASPECTRATIO=$(echo "scale=6; $NEWWIDTH / $NEWHEIGHT" | bc); echo $NEWASPECTRATIO
</pre></div>

<p>Once you have chosen NEWWIDTH and NEWHEIGHT such that
NEWASPECTRATIO is less than ASPECTRATIO - we can calculate the number
of pixels to crop the original width:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
CROP=$(echo "scale=6; tmp = $WIDTH - $NEWASPECTRATIO * $HEIGHT + 0.5; scale=0; tmp / 1" | bc)
LEFTCROP=$(echo "scale=0; $CROP / 2" | bc)
CROPPEDWIDTH=$(echo "$WIDTH - $CROP" | bc)
echo "Needed crop is $CROP pixels."
</pre></div>

<p>Double check that CROP is non-negative.</p>

<p>Now we can finally transform the video. Because mencoder is not capable of
creating a sensible multiplexed MPEG4 (in the presence of B frames anyway),
either giving errors or resulting in desynced audio; we have to ignore
the audio (to avoid the errors) and generate a RAW video (h264), instead
of directly an mpeg4 file. This path is a bit risky, especially because
mencoder doesn't write all needed information to the video stream - but
it turns out to work for me in those cases that I tried it.</p>

<p>We'll go for the highest quality transformation. Read the documention
of mencoder to find the meaning of the -x264encopts.
Also see <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-x264.html#menc-feat-x264-example-settings">this page</a>.</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mencoder &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; -vf crop=$CROPPEDWIDTH:$HEIGHT:$LEFTCROP:0,scale=$NEWWIDTH:$NEWHEIGHT,hqdn3d=2:1:2 -ovc x264 \
    -x264encopts subq=6:partitions=all:8x8dct:me=umh:frameref=5:bframes=3:b_pyramid:weight_b:threads=auto:bitrate=$NEWBITRATE:pass=1 \
    -of rawvideo -ofps $MFPS -mc 0 -noskip -nosound -o /dev/null
</pre></div>

<p>And the second and third pass both use <code>pass=3</code>:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mencoder &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; -vf crop=$CROPPEDWIDTH:$HEIGHT:$LEFTCROP:0,scale=$NEWWIDTH:$NEWHEIGHT,hqdn3d=2:1:2 -ovc x264 \
    -x264encopts subq=6:partitions=all:8x8dct:me=umh:frameref=5:bframes=3:b_pyramid:weight_b:threads=auto:bitrate=$NEWBITRATE:pass=3 \
    -of rawvideo -ofps $MFPS -mc 0 -noskip -nosound -o /dev/null
rm -f video.h264
mencoder &quot;$MKVFILE&quot; -vf crop=$CROPPEDWIDTH:$HEIGHT:$LEFTCROP:0,scale=$NEWWIDTH:$NEWHEIGHT,hqdn3d=2:1:2 -ovc x264 \
    -x264encopts subq=6:partitions=all:8x8dct:me=umh:frameref=5:bframes=3:b_pyramid:weight_b:threads=auto:bitrate=$NEWBITRATE:pass=3 \
    -of rawvideo -ofps $MFPS -mc 0 -noskip -nosound -o video.h264
</pre></div>

<p>Don't forget to remove <code>video.h264</code> before writing, because if the file exists, it will
be overwritten - but not truncated: the result will be a file with the largest possible size and
the end of the longest file will be still be visible after the end of the result. But anyway,
mencoder should end with a summary printing the size; for example:</p>

<pre class=output>
Video stream: 3892.795 kbit/s  (486599 B/s)  size: 3773719241 bytes  7755.289 secs  185943 frames
x264 [info]: slice I:3403  Avg QP:10.00  size: 47050
x264 [info]: slice P:82214 Avg QP:10.00  size: 29983
x264 [info]: slice B:100324 Avg QP:11.71  size: 11448
x264 [info]: mb I  I16..4: 15.1% 34.5% 50.4%
x264 [info]: mb P  I16..4:  3.6% 12.6% 16.2%  P16..4: 34.4% 16.4%  9.2%  2.0%  1.7%    skip: 4.0%
x264 [info]: mb B  I16..4:  0.7%  1.0%  2.4%  B16..8: 32.7%  5.7% 17.6%  direct:24.2%  skip:15.7%
x264 [info]: 8x8 transform  intra:36.7%  inter:28.7%
x264 [info]: ref P  65.8% 15.7%  8.2%  5.5%  4.7%
x264 [info]: ref B  75.2% 13.0%  5.3%  3.7%  2.9%
x264 [info]: kb/s:3892.7
</pre>

<p>Here you can see that the size is 3773719241 bytes (which be smaller than MAXVIDEOSIZE).
We can also see that there are I, P and B frames and that the real bitrate is 3892.7 kbit/s.</p>

<p>Now we transform this file into an mpeg4 file using MP4Box:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
rm -f video.mp4
MP4Box -fps $FPS -add video.h264 video.mp4
</pre></div>

<p>If you get the error message &quot;<code>gf_import_h264: Assertion `nal_start' failed.</code>&quot;, then
have a look <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=571738&aid=1448512&group_id=84101">here</a>.
Also note that MP4Box writes to <code>/tmp</code>, creating a file there with a size a little more than the size of <code>video.h264</code>.
If it runs out of disk space, you do not get a warning or error-- but it will crash in the second phase.
Make sure you have enough room in <code>/tmp</code> thus. Or alternatively you can try <em>instead</em>,</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
rm -f video.mp4
mp4creator -c video.h264 -rate $FPS video.mp4
</pre></div>

<p>Also here it is important to delete <code>video.mp4</code> before running
either command&mdash; or it will create a mess by trying to append the
stream.</p>

<p>For me this command prints &quot;<code>Error decoding sei message</code>&quot;, but it
seems you can ignore that. Just wait patiently until it is finished (it does
it's job quietly, which takes a while).</p>

<p>The last step is then to multiplex the video with the audio and
put them in a Matroska container again. Run the utility <code>mmg</code>
and add both <code>audio.ac3</code> and <code>video.mp4</code>,
and pick an appropriate output filename and click 'Start muxing'.
Or, alternatively, run mkvmerge directly with a command line like:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
mkvmerge -o the.matrix.revolutions.2003.DVD5.x264.mkv -a 0 -D -S audio.ac3 -d 1 -A -S video.mp4 --track-order 0:0,1:1
</pre></div>

<p>Note that if you need to correct an audio/video desync, this can be
done in this last command line. For example, suppose that in the original
you had to press the minus key twice in mplayer, delaying the audio 200 ms,
then by adding <code>--delay 0:200ms</code> directly in front of
<code>audio.ac3</code>, the audio track will be delayed 200 ms.
See <code>man mkvmerge</code> for more details.</p>
