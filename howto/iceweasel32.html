<h1>Debian amd64: iceweasel with i386 plugins, outside a chroot</h1>

<div id="date">Carlo Wood, Feb/Mar 2008</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you weren't already convinced that closed source sucked before, then surely
the experience of trying to browse the net with an amd64 machine will have won you over;
I could ponder on how much Microsoft is paying Adobe not to release a 64-bit version of
their flash plugin&mdash; but why Sun is categorically refusing to address our cry for
a 64-bit java plugin for mozilla based browsers for this many <em>years</em> is beyond me.</p>

<p>There are three approaches to work around this conspiracy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install everything in a 32-bit chroot and run the browser there.
<li>Use the 64-bit version of the browser and use a wrapper for the 32-bit plugins.</li>
<li>Use a 32-bit version of the browser without chroot (a bi-arch approach).
</ol>

<p>I used option 1 (the chroot) for a while, but that approach has
several annoying disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every external application started by iceweasel necessarily also runs inside
the 32-bit chroot. It is neat that you can assign programs to handle files
with certain extensions, but in most cases you want to run those applications
in your normal 64-bit environment of course (ie xmms, azureus, mplayer).
<li>If you download a file, you can only download it to the 32-bit
chroot. Of course you can bind mount several directories like your
home directory - but not every directory can be shared like that,
and all too often I found myself downloading to my home directory
just to make the file accessible, having to manually copy it in
to it's final destination from a 64-bit shell.
</ul>

<p>I tried option 2, but it was a <em>horror</em>. Maybe some day
that option will mature, but right now it's just not working for me.</p>

<p>That leaves option 3. However, the main disadvantage of that option
is that you simply can't install i386 debian packages on an amd64 system.
Therefore you have to fall-back to tar-balls and install everything
manually. I tried this too, with as result that anti-aliasing didn't
work anymore and java simply froze iceweasel.</p>

<h2>The Best Of Both Worlds</h2>

<p>The approach that I chose in the end is as follows:
I installed everything that has to be of i386 architecture
in a 32-bit chroot (as in option 1), using apt-get (or aptitude or whatever you like)
and used a small wrapper and environment variables to run the browser
in the 64-bit environment with a linux32 personality (as in option 3).</p>

<p>This turns out to a simple and painless procedure.</p>

<p>First, create an i386 chroot inside of which we will later install iceweasel.
This chroot will be much smaller than that of option 1 above, because
we won't need to install libraries that are already available from ia32
packages for the amd64 architecture.</p>

<p>You'll need some packages:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo apt-get install debootstrap
</pre></div>

<h3>Creating the chroot</h3>

<p>Choose the root of the chroot and it's handle:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
CHROOT="/opt/firefox-chroot";   # The directory of the chroot.
CHROOTNAME="firefox";           # The name as listed by schroot -l.
</pre></div>

<p>We need these too. You can set them to whatever works for you
but the following should set them automatically (as usually, in my HOWTO's,
just copy&amp;paste the whole block to your (non-root) shell prompt):</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
HELPVAR=$(apt-cache policy coreutils | egrep '^[[:space:][:digit:]]*http:' | \
    sed -r 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]+/,/g' | sort -rn | head -n 1)
SUITE=$(echo "$HELPVAR" | cut -d, -f 3 | sed -e 's%/.*%%')
DEBIANMIRROR=$(grep "^deb $(echo "$HELPVAR" | cut -d, -f 2).*$SUITE" /etc/apt/sources.list | \
    sed -r 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]+/,/g;s%/,%,%g;s%,%/,%g' | cut -d, -f 2)
echo -e "SUITE = \"$SUITE\"\nDEBIANMIRROR = \"$DEBIANMIRROR\""
</pre></div>

<p>This should set $SUITE to something like 'lenny' and $DEBIANMIRROR to something like 'http://ftp.debian.org/debian/'.</p>

<p>If SUITE is 'unstable', 'testing' or 'stable' then debootstrap won't work
without providing the current codename. Therefore, try to extract that:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
CODENAME=$SUITE
if test ! -e /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/$SUITE; then
  CODENAME=$(sed -ne 's/^Codename: \([a-z]*\)$/\1/p' /var/lib/apt/lists/$(echo "$DEBIANMIRROR" | sed -e "s%http://*%%;s%/%_%g")dists_"$SUITE"_Release)
fi
echo "CODENAME = $CODENAME"
</pre></div>

<p>Create the new directory and install the base system into it:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo mkdir "$CHROOT"
sudo debootstrap --arch i386 $SUITE "$CHROOT" $DEBIANMIRROR /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/$CODENAME
</pre></div>

<p>This installs about 180 MB in $CHROOT.</p>

<p>Since we won't run iceweasel inside the chroot, there is no need to
do (bind) mounts, or install home directories or whatever&mdash;
but we still need a few more packages to be installed.</p>

<p>Enter the chroot as root:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot "$CHROOT"
</pre></div>

<p>Before running apt-get, you might want to fix a few things:</p>

<p>In order to get rid of the message
&quot;<code>WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!</code>&quot;,
run the following command:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
apt-get update
</pre></div>

<p>This will retrieve the missing <code>Release.gpg</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to get rid of the warnings:</p>
<pre>
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
	LANGUAGE = (unset),
	LC_ALL = (unset),
	LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>then run the following commands (this installs an additional 18 MB)
(on etch <code>/etc/locale.gen</code> doesn't exist at this point. Assuming
you are using UTF-8 encoding (<code>$LC_CTYPE</code> contains the string UTF-8),
use instead of the sed command below:
<code>echo "$LC_CTYPE UTF-8" &gt; /etc/locale.gen</code>):</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
LANG= apt-get install locales
eval `locale 2&gt; /dev/null`
sed -ri 's/^([^#].*)/# \1/;s/^# ('$LC_CTYPE'($| .*))/\1/' /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
</pre></div>

<p>[ If you don't want that, then you can temporarily suppress these messages by doing <em>instead</em>:</p>

<pre>
eval `LANG= locale`
</pre>

<p>but you'd need to do that every time you enter the chroot for maintenance. ]</p>

<p>Next, edit <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> and add a line
for security updates (as usual, just copy&amp;paste the whole block to
the shell prompt (outside the chroot)):</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit # Leave the chroot
if ! grep 'security\.debian\.org' $CHROOT/etc/apt/sources.list; then
  sudo sh -c 'echo "# Security updates." &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list; \
  echo "deb http://security.debian.org/ '"$SUITE"'/updates main contrib" &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list'
fi
</pre></div>

<p>Also add <code>contrib</code> and <code>non-free</code>, as we'll need that for
the plugins later on:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo sed -ri 's/^(deb '$(echo $DEBIANMIRROR | sed 's/\/$//;s/\([$/.]\)/\\\1/g')' '$SUITE' main)$/\1 contrib non-free/' $CHROOT/etc/apt/sources.list
</pre></div>

<p>and update the chroot</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT apt-get update
sudo chroot $CHROOT apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre></div>

<h3>A More General chroot</h3>

<p>If you are just creating the chroot for running iceweasel, then
you can skip this paragraph. However, I can imagine that some people
are using this page to set up a more general chroot, for other
purposes; therefore I decided to add this paragraph that describes
how to finish the chroot so it can be used in general, just to have
all information in one place.</p>

<p>First you'll want to bind mount a few directories. Add the (output of)
the following to your /etc/fstab (the real one, not the one in the chroot!).</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit # Leave the chroot
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
# $CHROOTNAME chroot
/proc    $CHROOT/proc    none    bind     0 0
/dev     $CHROOT/dev     none    rbind    0 0
/tmp     $CHROOT/tmp     none    bind     0 0
/home    $CHROOT/home    none    bind     0 0
EOF
</pre></div>

<p>and possibly other directories. Try to avoid any directories
that debian installs files in however, or the chroot will overwrite
your system files (and vica versa) of course.</p>

<p class=warning>
<em>WARNING: If you '<code>rm -rf</code>' the </em><code>$CHROOT</code><em>
directory then everything (still) bind mounted will be deleted as well!
A 'bind mount' is not normally visible with '<code>df</code>', you
will need to do '<code>df -a</code>' to see it</em>
(I lost my home directory this way, while doing tests in order to write this howto)!</p>

<p>After adding those lines, they are still not mounted until you
reboot; so mount them manually this time:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo mount $CHROOT/proc
sudo mount $CHROOT/dev
sudo mount $CHROOT/tmp
sudo mount $CHROOT/home
</pre></div>

<p>Note that you can also bind mount from the command line without
adding the extra configuration lines to <code>/etc/fstab</code>.
You'll need <code>--rbind</code> for <code>/dev</code>,
because otherwise <code>/dev/pts</code> isn't included. For example,</p>

<pre>
sudo mount --bind /proc $CHROOT/proc
sudo mount --rbind /dev $CHROOT/dev
sudo mount --bind /tmp $CHROOT/tmp
</pre>

<p>You'll want to use <code>schroot</code> to switch to the
chroot as a normal user:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo apt-get install schroot
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, fix your <code>/etc/schroot/schroot.conf</code> and possibly
setup a little wrapper and symlinks as is described in
<a href="http://alioth.debian.org/docman/view.php/30192/21/debian-amd64-howto.html#id292486">Running applications inside a chroot using schroot</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, back to installing iceweasel.</p>

<h3>Installing Iceweasel</h3>

<p>Enter the chroot and install iceweasel (this drags in another 130 MB)
and fix <code>/usr/lib/iceweasel/iceweasel</code> not to be anal about
where it's installed:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT
apt-get --yes install libgconf2-4
apt-get --yes install iceweasel
sed -i 's/^MOZ_DIST_BIN=.*/MOZ_DIST_BIN="$(dirname $0)"/' /usr/lib/iceweasel/iceweasel
</pre></div>

<h3>Setting Up A Wrapper</h3>

<p>Leave the chroot and install some needed libraries:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit              # Leave the chroot
sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-gtk
</pre></div>

<p>Installing iceweasel already dragged in so many libraries into
the chroot, that <code>ia32-libs-gtk</code> is only really need for
<code>/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines/libclearlooks.so</code>.
I can imagine that it's possible to remove (a lot of) libraries
from the chroot because they are already installed as some ia32
package in your amd64 environment, but at this moment I'm too
lazy to look into that (for the few cents worth of diskspace).</p>

<p>Next, create the wrapper to start iceweasel;
for example, create a file <code>/usr/local/bin/firefox</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo sh -c 'cat &gt; /usr/local/bin/firefox &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_PATH="/usr/lib32/gtk-2.0"
CHROOT="'$CHROOT'"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/lib32:/usr/lib32:\$CHROOT/lib:\$CHROOT/usr/lib"
linux32 "\$CHROOT/usr/lib/iceweasel/iceweasel" "\$@"
EOF'
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/firefox
</pre></div>

<p>This should create a file with content like the following:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_PATH="/usr/lib32/gtk-2.0"
CHROOT="/opt2/firefox-chroot"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/lib32:/usr/lib32:$CHROOT/lib:$CHROOT/usr/lib"
linux32 "$CHROOT/usr/lib/iceweasel/iceweasel" "$@"
</pre>

<p>At this point everything should work except plugins: It's using your
normal home directory, and thus <code>~/.mozilla</code> and thus your
bookmarks, preferences, cookies, passwords etc. Also anti-aliasing should
work fine already at this point, as well as "File Type / Download Actions"
(Preferences -&gt; Content -&gt; File Types, Manage...), which will run
your external applications as 64-bit applications now.</p>

<p>Note that the wrapper sets <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to both,
<code>[/usr]/lib32</code> as well as <code>$CHROOT[/usr]/lib</code>,
both containing 32-bit libraries. The latter are needed because
not all needed 32-bit libraries are provided by <code>ia32-libs</code>
and <code>ia32-libs-gtk</code>. But why prepend the path with
the lib32 ones? Surely every needed 32-bit library could be installed
in the chroot? The reason for this is that some of the libraries
contain hardcoded paths, or should I say, one library contains
a hardcoded path... <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0</code>
contains the hardcoded path <code>/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/loaders</code>.
This causes it to read the files in <code>/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/loader-files.d</code>,
which contain libraries paths in <code>/usr/lib</code>, 64-bit libraries.
Therefore it is needed to load libraries from <code>/usr/lib32</code>
before <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib</code>.</p>

<h2>Installing Plugins</h2>

<p>Installing plugins, which are loaded when the browser is already running,
should be easy. The only remaining problem might be hard-coded paths for
externally run programs (like java_vm). Flash should not give any problems,
so lets start with that.</p>

<h3>Installing The Flash Plugin</h3>

<p><b>Fonts</b></p>

<p>Flash applications often use Microsoft core fonts, and simply don't
display any text if you don't have them (which can be very confusing).
Therefore, you better install them as well (in the amd64 root):</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
</pre></div>

<p>After you installed the plugin, you can test if that worked
<a href="msttcorefonts.swf">here</a>. Besides <code>TEXT1</code>,
<code>TEXT2</code> and <code>TEXT3</code>, you should see a
<code>TEXT4</code>.</p>

<p>The whole point of the chroot is to make it easy to install and
update the plugins. So, just enter the chroot and install the plugin
the debian way:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
</pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately the debian "maintainers" decided to <em>remove</em>
this plugin from debian as of lenny. The plugin is now only
available if you're using etch or when you're using unstable.
See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=457291">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=457291</a>
for their reasons.</p>

<p>If the above didn't work then you'll have to use the
package from unstable (codename: sid). Once lenny has
become stable, and you are using stable you should use
the backport (see below).</p>

<p>If you're using testing&mdash; then you might want to create
the backport yourself, because backports.org is for 'stable',
following the instructions below (adapted from
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-package.en.html#s-port">6.4.10 Port a package to the stable system</a>
from the debian reference manual). However, you might want
to try to just use the 'stable' backport (hoping your libs are
compatible; what they usually should be because 'testing' is newer
than 'stable').</p>

<p><b>In order to compile the backport yourself</b> do the following:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit # Leave chroot
if ! grep '^deb-src.*unstable' $CHROOT/etc/apt/sources.list; then
  sudo sh -c 'echo "# Sources from unstable." &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list; \
  echo "deb-src '"$DEBIANMIRROR"' unstable main contrib non-free" &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list'
fi
sudo chroot $CHROOT
apt-get update
apt-get --yes install build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper;  # Installs 65 MB.
cd /usr/src
mkdir flashplugin-nonfree
cd flashplugin-nonfree
apt-get source flashplugin-nonfree
cd flashplugin-nonfree-*
apt-get --yes build-dep flashplugin-nonfree
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc
dpkg -i ../flashplugin-nonfree_*_i386.deb
apt-get purge build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper
apt-get autoremove;                                             # Free 65 MB again.
cd /usr/src
rm -rf flashplugin-nonfree
</pre></div>

<p>A disadvantage of this method is that it won't upgrade
flash when a new release is available.</p>

<p><b>In order to use backports.org</b> do the following (adapted from
<a href="http://backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions">here</a>).
I'd urge you to use pinning so that upgrading later on will be automatic.</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit # Leave chroot
STABLECODENAME=etch;  # Change this if needed!
if ! grep '^deb http://www\.backports\.org' $CHROOT/etc/apt/sources.list; then
  sudo sh -c 'echo "# Stable backports." &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list; \
  echo "deb http://www.backports.org/debian '"$STABLECODENAME"'-backports main contrib non-free" &gt;&gt; '"$CHROOT"'/etc/apt/sources.list'
fi
sudo chroot $CHROOT
apt-get update
wget -O - http://backports.org/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -
exit
sudo chroot $CHROOT apt-get --yes --force-yes -t '"$STABLECODENAME"'-backports install flashplugin-nonfree
</pre></div>

<p><b>In order to use www.adobe.com</b> do the following.</p>

<p>Since the support from debian is basically gone,
you might also opt for the alternative to download
the flashplayer from Adobe yourself and simply drop
it in <code>~/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note that flash player 9.0 r115 (which you will get if
you download it now) and later have stricter policy files
which can cause your client to not be able to connect anymore to
certain servers.</b> See for example <a href="http://www.gotoandlearnforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=14967">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/fplayer9_security.html">Adobes article</a> on the matter.
Version 9.0 r48 and r31 work fine for me. You can obtain the version of your
current <code>libflashplayer.so</code> with:</p>

<pre>
strings $CHROOT/usr/lib/iceweasel/plugins/libflashplayer.so | grep -e "^Shockwave Flash [.\d+]*" | sed -e "s/Shockwave Flash //g"
</pre>

<p>The version is also visible in <code>about:plugins</code></p>

<p>Download <code>install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz</code>
from http://www.adobe.com/ and save and extract the tar-ball,
change directory to the extracted content and run as <em>non-root</em>:</p>

<pre>
linux32 ./flashplayer-installer
</pre>

<p>to install the plugin in ~/.mozilla/plugins, or run as root
to install system wide (the wrapper must be system wide too then, of course).
In the latter case enter <code>&lt;CHROOT&gt;/usr/lib/iceweasel</code> as
browser directory, where you should replace <code>&lt;CHROOT&gt;</code>
with the value of your <code>$CHROOT</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to test it of course.
Try this <a href="http://www.nonoba.com/ballerbryan4/age-of-war">cool site</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing An Embedded PDF Viewer Plugin</h3>

<p>I wasted two days trying to get acroread to work, but it's broken.
Seriously, this is not incompetence; Adobe's acrobat reader really sucks.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is an open source alternative and that means
that if <em>that</em> doesn't work, we can fix it!</p>

<p>Firstly install <code>mozplugger</code> in the firefox chroot,
and evince on your amd64:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT apt-get --yes install mozplugger
sudo apt-get install evince
</div></pre>

<p>This should immediately allow you to watch movies inside the browser
(provided you have mplayer installed in your amd64 environment); try
to open some .avi from your harddisk with the browser. Also have a look
at <code>about:plugins</code> again. Wait, ... watching PDF and postscript
works too. It just all works! I love open source.</p>

<h3>Installing The Java Plugin</h3>

<p>More closed source... Yes, java is open source these days, but the
plugin isn't: Sun refuses to release a 64-bit plugin for java, and when
that was really open source, it would have been ported long ago.</p>

<p>The following commands will make java work:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT
apt-get --yes install libnss-mdns
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/i386/jli
apt-get --yes --force-yes install sun-java6-bin
</div>

<p>The <code>export</code> is needed as work around for bug #435293
in the Debian bug tracking system. The package <code>libnss-mdns</code>
is needed because otherwise java just hangs firefox with 100% cpu
usage. You don't want to know what I all needed to do to find that
THAT was needed! Unfortunately, I still don't know WHY it is needed,
rather unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Finally, we need:</p>

<div class="command"><pre>
exit # Leave chroot
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjavaplugin.so firefox-javaplugin.so $CHROOT/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so 100
sudo update-alternatives --set firefox-javaplugin.so $CHROOT/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
</pre></div>

<p>The first <code>update-alternatives</code> command (see <code>man update-alternatives</code>) creates (or appends to)
a group <code>firefox-javaplugin.so</code> with generic name <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjavaplugin.so</code>
and possible value <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so</code>.
The group is created in automatic mode, using the (arbitrarily chosen) priority 100. The second
<code>update-alternatives</code> command sets the group in manual mode and permanently links it to
the given value. In effect, the result is that a symbolic link <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjavaplugin.so</code>
points to <code>/etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so</code> which in turn points to
<code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so</code>.</p>

<p>So why is this needed? Well, when run, <code>iceweasel</code> tries to load
all shared libraries in <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins</code>,
the installation of <code>sun-java6-bin</code> in the chroot created an alternative
with the name <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins</code> in the chroot that points to
<code>/etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so</code>, exactly as we just did thus (and
even if it didn't do that; firefox simply loads everything from <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins</code>
in the amd64 root!).
Therefore, either by reading the link <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins</code> or
by reading a hardcoded path <code>/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins</code>, it
is refered to <code>/etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so</code> <em>in the amd64 root</em>!
Hence, we need to add this alternative/symlink and point it back to the correct shared library
in the chroot. There is a minor problem with this however. Suppose one day you run 'apt-get update &amp; apt-get upgrade'
in the chroot, and it changes the symbolic link&mdash; then <em>our</em> manually added link will
not change along and java will simply not work anymore. In that case you will have to update
this alternative manually. It is unlikely that it will change however: the name of the package
is sun-java6-bin, containing the '6', so at most the 'ns7' part might change one day
to 'ns8'? Or is it? In fact, even during the few days that I was testing this
these values have been changed! In the beginning, I needed:</p>

<p>If this link is wrong then the effect will be that no plugin for java is visible in <code>about:plugins</code>.
In that case the correct link can be found with the <code>strace</code> trick described below and looking for
a directory that firefox searches for plugins.</p>

<h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>

<p>I don't know why&mdash; but I decided to add this paragraph; maybe I don't
feel too sure about that it will work for everyone, or I just want to show
people how cool hacking is (the real meaning of the word, not 'breaking
into computers' which is just sad, boring and immature and done by non-hackers).
Actually, this is more a do-it-yourself recipe than a trooble-shoot section...</p>

<p>First of all, we realize that knowing the PID of a running process we can see
what libraries it loaded by looking at <code>/proc/PID/maps</code>.
For example; I kill my xmms and then click on a some .pls file inside the
browser (I have iceweasel configured to start .pls files with xmms).
As this works, I already know that the 64-bit version of xmms is started
because I never installed xmms in the chroot, but suppose we want to check
this. First we find the PID of the running xmms and how it was started:</p>

<div class="output"><pre>
hikaru:~&gt;ps --forest aux | grep -A3 '[f]irefox'
carlo    31887  0.0  0.0  10656  1548 ?        S    00:30   0:00 /bin/sh /home/carlo/bin/firefox
carlo    31888  0.6  0.9 116536 36884 ?        Sl   00:30   0:02  \_ /opt2/firefox-chroot/usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin -a firefox
carlo    32066  0.0  0.2 239012 11544 ?        Sl   00:34   0:00      \_ /usr/bin/xmms /tmp/goapsy.pls
</pre></div>

<p>This shows that the PID of <code>xmms</code> is 32066 and that is was indeed started by firefox-bin.</p>

<p>Of course, we can use <code>file</code> to see the type of each of
the two executables involved:</p>

<div class="output"><pre>
hikaru:~&gt;file /opt2/firefox-chroot/usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin
/opt2/firefox-chroot/usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
hikaru:~&gt;file /usr/bin/xmms
/usr/bin/xmms: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
</pre></div>

<p>which shows that firefox-bin is 32-bit and xmms is 64-bit. Of course we could have known
by just looking at the path, too.
Finally, we can explicitely look at the libraries loaded by xmms (applying a filter to reduce the output a bit):</p>

<p>Each of the libraries should be either in <code>/emul/ia32-linux</code>
or in <code>/opt2/firefox-chroot</code>, of course. We see one mapped
file that is from the 64-bit install: <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>.
But that file is neither 32-bit nor 64-bit architecture. Nevertheless, since it
resides in <code>/usr/lib</code> it is probably related to some
library. I used the following rather brute force way to find out which:</p>

<div class="output"><pre>
hikaru:~&gt;for f in $(cat /proc/985/maps | grep lib | sed -e 's/.* //' | sort -u); do if strings $f | grep 'locale-archive'; then echo $f; fi; done
/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
/opt2/firefox-chroot/lib/libc-2.7.so
</pre></div>

<p>This shows that <code>/opt2/firefox-chroot/lib/libc-2.7.so</code>
is the library that has this filename hard-coded. That's a good
thing because libc won't suddenly drastically change; as long as
we are using the same suite in the chroot as well as in the normal
file system, the version of the library should be the same enough
to be able to use each others files. In fact, although not installed
by the libc6 package but rather generated, the file has the exact
same size in each of the roots:</p>

<div class="output"><pre>
hikaru:~&gt;ls -l /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive $CHROOT/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1282816 2008-02-03 20:25 /opt2/firefox-chroot/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1282816 2008-01-28 00:49 /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
</pre></div>

<p>I made a diff of the hexdump-- and I don't think this is something
we have to worry about.</p>

<p>Another issue is the mixture of libraries from <code>/emul/ia32-linux</code>
and <code>/opt2/firefox-chroot</code> respectively. Again, although both
are the same suite, it might happen that libraries the i386 architecture
get out of sync with those in the ia32 libs of the amd64 suite, especially
if you don't run 'apt-get update/upgrade' in both roots at the same time.
The question is therefore: can this cause problems? I don't think so,
but if you HAVE problems and you suspect that this might be the cause,
then you might want to try to get rid of the libraries loaded from
<code>/emul/ia32-linux</code>. You would have to remove the <code>[/usr]/lib32</code>
paths from <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and install packages
in the chroot for any remaining library that is missing. You'd also need
to find a solution for the hardcoded path in <code>libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0</code>.
Those extra packages would be (I tried that):
<code>gtk2-engines</code> (<code>libclearlooks.so</code>), <code>libgconf2-4</code> (<code>libgconf-2.so.4.1.2</code>),
<code>liborbit2</code> (<code>libORBit-2.so.0.1.0</code>) and <code>libpango1.0-0<code> (</code>pango-basic-fc.so<code>).</p>

<p>Now that is weird: <code>libpango1.0-0</code> <em>is</em> already installed in the chroot!
Apparently we should tell pango where to look for it's modules. This would be possible
by setting the environment variable PANGO_RC_FILE and have it point to a file
with a section <code>[Pango]</code> containing <code>ModuleFiles=/path/to/libpango1.0-0.modules</code>,
where the paths in that libpango1.0-0.modules files are fixed to incorporate the
chroot offset. Neither, <code>/emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib/pango/1.6.0/module-files.d/libpango1.0-0.modules</code>
nor <code>$CHROOT/usr/lib/pango/1.6.0/module-files.d/libpango1.0-0.modules</code> could be used,
because they contain absolute paths. Anyway, so far I have not seen this to cause
any problems so I see no need to do this.</p>

<p>With all these hard-coded paths, it would be a wild guess how and where
iceweasel looks for plugin files, or how it tries to start the java virtual machine.
Therefore I'll conclude this paragraph with a way to strace iceweasel.</p>

<p>Iceweasel has provisions to run it inside a debugger. We can hijack that and start it through strace. 
First, install <code>strace</code> in the chroot:</p>

<pre>
sudo chroot $CHROOT
apt-get install strace
exit
</pre>

<p>Please make sure you use at least version 4.5.15 of strace (also on your amd64), or
you'll likely to run into the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=218043">umovestr I/O errors on 32-binaries</a> bug.
Version 4.5.15 is at the moment of writing only in unstable, hence, if you still have 4.5.14 or earlier, use:
<code>apt-get -t unstable install strace</code>, which worked fine for me on lenny (actually,
I still get 'umovestr I/O errors' when running (32-bit) firefox inside (64-bit) strace
which subsequently starts a 64-bit external application again. In the case that you
need to strace an external application, you'll have to run firefox without strace
and insert the strace at the right place in some script).</p>

<p>Then run</p>

<pre>
firefox --debugger "$CHROOT/usr/bin/strace -f -o output -e trace=file" "about:plugins"
</pre>

<p>where <code>firefox</code> is our little wrapper.
This will write every system call involving a file- or directory name to the file <code>output</code>.</p>
