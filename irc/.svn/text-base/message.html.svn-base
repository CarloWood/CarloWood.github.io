<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>You are reading this page because you have been refered to it.&nbsp;
Most likely as a result of messaging Run on IRC.&nbsp;
This page has been written to give you a standard feedback, one that
I don't have time to give to everyone on IRC; it is my hope that you
will like reading this page better than the alternative: being ignored.</P>

<H1>Who are you?</H1>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#close-friend">I am a close friend of you.</A>
<LI><A HREF="#friend">We are friends.</A>
<LI><A HREF="#known">We have chatted before, you know me.</A>
<LI><A HREF="#stranger">I am a stranger, or I am not sure that you will remember me.</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="close-friend">
<H2>I am a close friend of you</H2>

<P>If you've been refered to this page automatically then that was by accident.&nbsp;
Please tell me on the channel that you got refered to it.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course you already know everything that is below :).</P>

<A NAME="friend">
<H2>We are friends</H2>

<P>I read all private messages, but I hate to respond to it.&nbsp;
The reason for that is that I think that IRC is for socializing:
I really want to do <EM>all</EM> chat on the channel (you know which
or you're reading the wrong paragraph).&nbsp;
I also don't put time into another channel.&nbsp; When I am on IRC
I am in <B>one</B> room - and you can count on it that if I am not
away from the keyboard then I will be reading what is said in that
room: I am <EM>there</EM>.&nbsp;
I hate it when other people are on the channel, and not being marked
as "away", but still are not really <EM>present</EM> because they
are too busy in other channels or with private conversations.&nbsp;
What makes hanging around on IRC nice is to know that my friends are
there - even while we don't talk (we're programming or working, right?) -
but type a smiley on the channel and everyone smiles back.
That is what makes me feel good :)</P>

<P>When you feel that a message is better not said on the channel
then you can message me, but don't expect me to confirm I read that:
I <EM>did</EM> read it.&nbsp;
If you are totally confused that apparently I didn't feel like
reacting and you can't understand why etc. then ask me <EM>on the
channel</EM> if I received your private message.</P>

<P>Finally it is possible that you consider yourself a friend of me
but you're not too sure about it.&nbsp;
For those cases let me give you a few guidelines:</P>
<P>Never ask me "How are you", never ask me "Do you still love me?"
or "I thought we were friends" or "Don't you like me any more" etc.</P>
<P>Use 're' instead of 'wb'.&nbsp; Don't use winblows.&nbsp; Don't try
to talk with me about irc related issues except (and <EM>on</EM> the
channel) when there is huge lag and a reroute is in order.</P>

<A NAME="known">
<H2>We have chatted before, you know me</H2>

<P>I <EM>might</EM> be interested to continue our previous conversation
about the <EM>same</EM> topic, but in general, just follow the guidelines
below.</P>

<A NAME="stranger">
<H2>I am a stranger, or I am not sure that you will remember me</H2>

<P>In general I do <B>not</B> react to messages.&nbsp;
However, I <B>do</B> read them (guaranteed!).&nbsp;
You are allowed (and welcome) to tell me complete stories in private.&nbsp;
Just don't do any of the following:</P>

<A NAME="list">
<UL>
<LI>repeat yourself.
<LI>ask if you can ask me a question.
<LI>ask if I am there (that is the same as the previous one).
<LI>ask me "whats up" or "where are you from" or "how are you".
<LI>ask me if you're being ignored.
<LI>ask me if I can help you with a channel.
<LI>ask me to help you with configuration of ircu.
<LI>make a remark that you expect a reaction to without ending
the line on a '?'.&nbsp; I do <B>not</B> react to messages that
are not a question.
<LI>ask me a question without providing the needed information
to answer it.&nbsp; I will <B>not</B> ask you to give more information,
you will have to do that on your own.
<LI>ask a trivial question.
<LI>ask me to wallop something.
<LI>ask a question that implies actions based on my answer without
specifying those actions.&nbsp; For example, ask: "If I ask you to
KILL me, will you do that?" instead of "Did you ever KILL on request
before?".&nbsp; I'd feel manipulated with the latter one.&nbsp;
Another example is a question like "Do you have time right now?",
which clearly can not be answered without falling into your trap
(unless I *always* answer "that depends" - in which case you can list
this question under "trivial").
</UL>

<P>If you don't feel like typing a whole lot of information without
knowing in advance if I am there, or if I am willing to answer it at
all, then first ask a question that I can answer with yes or no for
which not much information is needed, in order to find out if I will
be willing to answer it.&nbsp; For example, instead of dumping a gdb
stack trace to me and parts of your program, first ask me: "I wrote
a program in C++ on linux that uses your libcwd.  It core dumps on me
and I've spend three days trying to figure out what it is.  Now I have
reason to believe that this involves a bug in libcwd itself.  Do you
want me to provide you with more information?".&nbsp; Note if you
end that sentence with "Are you interested?" then I might not react
because I want questions that relate to actions of <EM>you</EM>.</P>

<A NAME="noreply">
<H1>Specification of what you did wrong</H1>

<OL>
<LI>You asked me to help you with an IRC related issue.&nbsp; The answer is: no.
<LI>You did not give enough information to answer that question.
<LI>You did not ask a question.
<LI>You are being annoying, please stop messaging me.
<LI>I haven't got time for that question now, otherwise I would have answered it.
<LI>I don't feel like answering this question because it is unclear
what you will do with the answer, see the last point in the <A HREF="#list">list</A> above.
<LI>I have no authority on that subject; please consult other sources.
<LI>You asked me "whats up", "where are you from" or "how are you".
<LI>You asked me "can I ask a question?" or similar.
</OL>

<H1>What <EM>will</EM> you react to?</H1>

<P>That depends, but to give you an idea - here are some examples:
a really funny remark; a non-trivial question that I can answer with
yes or no and that isn't vague about what you intend to do with the
answer; a really interesting topic brought to me by an intelligent
person (IQ > 150); a challenging puzzle; an opinion that makes me
want to share my opinion as well; a correction of something I said
wrongly in a wallops; a question related to libcwd, or C++ in general...
and many other things.</P>
