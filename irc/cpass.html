<H1>Channel Recovery For All Project (Apass/Upass)</H1>

<H4>Last updated: 7 March 2005</H4>

<BR>
<H2>Technical Details</H2>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><P>First multi-level ops are introduced.&nbsp;
The most powerful level is level 0.&nbsp;
There should be at least extra level (level 1; higher numeric values means less power).&nbsp;
An op will not be able to de-op or kick someone with a lower or equal&sup1; level.<P>
<P STYLE="font-size: smaller">
&sup1;This is to prevent op-less channels as a result of stupid bots that de-op people.
</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>When someone creates a channel, either with JOIN locally or with
CREATE, then he gets level 0 ops.&nbsp;
This person is also marked as 'channel manager'.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Two passwords per channel are introduced: Upass and Apass.&nbsp;
A new channel has neither set.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If on a channel with Upass set, someone with level x gives ops to
someone else, then that person gets level x+1.&nbsp;
On other channels, where Upass is not set, the level stays the same.</P></LI>

<LI><P>When the Apass is not set then the channel manager&sup1; can set it.&nbsp;
It cannot be set when the Apass already exists.&nbsp;
When set, the following message is sent to the user:
<pre>
   *** Channel Admin password (+A) set to 'secret'. Are you SURE you want
       to use this as Admin password? You will NOT be able to change this
       password anymore once the channel is more than 48 hours old!
   *** Use "/MODE #channel -A secret" to remove the password and then
       immediatly set a new one. IMPORTANT: YOU CANNOT RECOVER THIS
       PASSWORD, EVER; WRITE THE PASSWORD DOWN (don't store this rescue
       password on disk)! Now set the channel user password (+U).
</pre>
</P></LI>

<P STYLE="font-size: smaller">
&sup1;This will be the channel creator.<BR>
</P>

<LI><P>A channel stays alive and remembers the Apass (and Upass if set and all
other modes) for 60 seconds&sup1; after it is emptied.&nbsp;
Channels that are older than 48 hours will stay alive for 48 hours though.<P>
<P STYLE="font-size: smaller">
&sup1;For accidently closing windows and for 'playing' with the system to
get to know it.
</P>
</P></LI>

<LI><P>The Apass can only be removed in the first 48 hours by the channel manager.
Adding it is always possible, provided there is no Apass set, as long as the user
is still marked as channel manager (either by creating the channel or by joining
with the Apass; for example, a user that joined using the Apass of a channel can
set a new Apass even when the channel is more than 48 hours old, if an IRC Operator
removes the old Apass after he joined.)</P></LI>

<LI><P>Recovery in case of Apass compromises:
If the Apass is forgotten, then the only way to reset the password is
by leaving the channel for 48 hours (or 60 seconds when the channel is
younger than 48 hours).&nbsp;
A special 'recovery' mode might be introduced later so that users who know the
Upass can do this.&nbsp;
During this time, in case of a channel takeover, others will have the
time to contact the real channel manager who can restore the channel to
its real owners by using the Apass.<BR>
An IRC Operator is allowed to remove the Apass, provided he knows it,
independent of the age of the channel.
Also the IRC operator will need to use the Apass (the channel manager will
have to tell him what it is).&nbsp;
This is only to speed up the recovery process in case someone 'leaked'
the Apass (ie, he dumped it on the channel), in that case people can ask
an IRC operator to mediate and find out who is the real, original channel
manager and restore the channel to him by setting a different Apass.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If someone joins an existing channel that has Apass set, using
<pre>
   JOIN #channel Apass
</pre>
then this person can join through +bikl and gets level-0 ops.&nbsp;
He will be marked as 'channel manager'.&nbsp;
The 'channel manager' can not talk to the channel
(to discourage people from using the Apass by default, which
would increase the chance that it is 'leaked').</P></LI>

<LI><P>The channel manager can set or remove the Upass at any time by using:
<pre>
   MODE #channel +U Upass
   MODE #channel -U Upass
</pre>

<LI><P>If someone joins an existing channel that has Upass set, using
<pre>
   JOIN #channel Upass
</pre>
then this person can join through +bikl and gets level-1 ops
(so that a trusted op will be able to recover from
a channel takeover in the case all other ops where nuked or
disconnected accidently for other reasons).</P></LI>

<LI><P>Level 0 and 1 ops can do
<pre>
   MODE #channel
</pre>
and will be sent the current Upass (along with all other modes as usual).&nbsp;
(This is because when the channel manager sets the Upass, it is NOT
visible to the channel members; it is also to recover the Upass
when the channel manager forgot the Upass and nobody else is around
to tell him what it was (you need the Upass to remove the Upass)).</P></LI>
</OL>


<P>Please note the following:</P>

<P>Channels that are older than 48 hours and use services are not affected.
Services will be able to hack modes on channels that use Upass/Apass,
although I advise strongly against the implementation of a command
that allows an IRC operator to get the Apass of a channel in order to
avoid social engineering and making IRC operators have <em>less</em> power
than channel managers (this in order to remove the reason to DOS IRC
operators); from the very start the word has to be: sorry, but you will
have to contact the channel manager&nbsp;-&nbsp;I&nbsp;CANNOT help (for the
second level help -- only the channel manager CAN get help from IRC operators,
when they give them their Apass).</P>

<H2>Required server-server Protocol Changes</H2>

<dl compact>
<dt>MODE</dt>

<p><dd>An extension to the server-server protocol has been added that
introduces oplevels to MODEs: MODE #channel +o nick:oplevel
This is possible because a colon is not a possible character in a nick.</p>

<dt>BURST</dt>

<p><dd>Net.junctions need to synchronize the op-levels.&nbsp;
This is done by including the op-levels in the BURST message.</p>
<p>The nick/mode string in the BURST message will be changed as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First all members without ops or voice are listed.</li>
<li>Then all members with only voice are listed.</li>
<li>Then all members with ops but without voice are listed.</li>
<li>Finally all members with ops <em>and</em> voice are listed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nick/mode string exist of comma seperated tokens of
the form <tt>&lt;numnick&gt;[:[v][&lt;digits&gt;]]</tt>.</p>
<p>A field of the form <tt>&lt;numnick&gt;</tt> that is not followed
by a colon represents a channel member with the same mode and op-level
as the previous member (starting with no ops/voice).</p>
<p>A field that includes a <tt>v</tt> means that this member (and the
following members) will have voice, optionally following digits
will be the absolute value of the op-level of the current member, without
those digits it means that this member (and the following members) do
not have ops.</p>
<p>A field of the form <tt>&lt;numnick&gt;:&lt;digits&gt;</tt> means that
this member (and the following members) have the <em>same</em> mode as
the previous one (starting with +o and level 0) and the digits represent
a decrement in the op-level.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, a field that includes an 'o' (not a zero)
means that this member (and the following members) have ops with op-level
<code>MAXOPLEVEL</code> so that everyone can de-op or kick these ops.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
  xxx,sss:v,ttt,aaa:123,bbb,ccc:2,ddd,kkk:v2,lll:2,mmm
</pre>

<p>means:</p>

<pre>
  xxx
  sss +v
  ttt +v
  aaa -123
  bbb -123
  ccc -125
  ddd -125
  kkk -2 +v
  lll -4 +v
  mmm -4 +v
</pre>

<h4>Summary for service coders</h4>

<pre>
                  ----------------------------------------
                  |  Current state :| +ov | +o | +v |  - |
----------------------------------------------------------
seen after a ':'  \                 \___ New State________
          :ov     |                 |  ov | ov | ov | ov |
	  :v456   |                 |  ov | ov | ov | ov |
	  :o      |                 |  o  | o  | o  | o  |
	  :456    |                 |  ov | o  | ov | o  |
	  :v      |                 |  v  | v  | v  | v  |
	  :       |                 |  -  | -  | -  | -  |
</pre>

<p>Finally, the modes 'A' and 'U' will be added in the same manner as
currently 'k' and 'l': with a parameter.  A BURST can only <em>set</em>
a password, when there no password in the BURST - it is not
wiped out (unless the timestamps mismatch).&nbsp;
Synchronization as a result of changing a Upass during a net-break
is done by decrementing the creation time of the channel with one.&nbsp;
It is possible for the channel manager to connect to two sides of
a net.break and change the Upass on both sides but to different
values - there will be a desync then - it is his channel.</p>

<p>Normally the channel manager can not change the Apass, but in
the case that the channel is younger than 48 hours and the Apass
was changed during a net.break - then the Apass will be desynced.&nbsp;
In order to restore this, the Apass is resent every time a
channel manager uses it (which should be seldom), see bottom
of page.</p>

<dt>JOIN</dt>

<p><dd>The password is tested locally.  There is no change in the server-server
protocol.&nbsp;
When the Upass is used and a MODE is needed, then the MODE
will be sent as a MODE +o with respectively level 0 or 1 by the local server
(The HACK detection was turned off for this.)</p>

<dt>DESTRUCT</dt>

<p><dd>A new message is introduced to destruct (empty) channels.&nbsp;
A DESTRUCT message has the format &quot;&lt;prefix&gt; DE &lt;channel&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt;&quot;,
for example &quot;A8 DE #channel 1015908373&quot;.</P>

<p><dd>If the channel does not exist or when the creationtime of the
channel is older than the timestamp on the DESTRUCT message then the
message must be ignored.&nbsp;
Otherwise, when the channel is not empty, a BURST message must be
bounced back.&nbsp; Or when the channel is empty a DESTRUCT message
(with the prefix of the local server) must be send in all directions,
also in the direction the message was received from (services don't
have to do that if it is certain that there was never sent a JOIN or
CREATE in that direction).</p>

<dt>Passwords</dt>

<p><dd>The passwords are propagated in the same way as the channel key
(MODE +k) by means of MODE and BURST. The passwords are *never* send
to clients (except for the Upass in the case of a /MODE #channel, but
a level 0 or 1 op), instead a '*' is used as parameter.&nbsp;
A BURST that wipes out modes because of a timestamp mismatch will also wipe
out any passwords set. Services should not store the passwords and
<em>certainly</em> not send them in a BURST (the channel manager is
always on the other side of the net.break so we're not interested in
what the service thinks the password is).</p>
