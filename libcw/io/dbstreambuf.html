<H1>Dynamic Blocks stream buffer</H1>

<A name="intro"></A>
<H2>2.1 Introduction</H2>

<A name ="About"></A>
<H3>2.1.1 About this chapter</H3>

<P>This chapter describes class <SPAN class="code">dbstreambuf_ct</SPAN>,
which is derived from the ANSI/ISO C++ class <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN>.</P>

<P>Seldom a class is derived from <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN>;
chances are that you never used anything else for stream buffering
than the standard <I>streambuf</I> class from your C++ library.</P>

<P>The knowledge needed to understand and work with a streambuf class
(a class derived from streambuf) is too large to be covered in this
chapter, hence a basic knowledge about stream buffers is presumed.&nbsp;
If you have no idea what a streambuf is and don't want to know it,
then you can skip this chapter: It will not be of concern to you.</P>

<A name ="wchar_t"></A>
<H3>2.1.2 No <SPAN class="H3code">wchar_t</SPAN></H3>

<P>For historical reasons a <I>streambuf</I> controls input from and
output to <I>character</I> sequences.&nbsp; ANSI/ISO C++ supports both <I>char</I>
and <I>wchar_t</I> by defining the template basic_streambuf&lt;class charT&gt;
and defining streambuf with:<BR>
<SPAN class="code">typedef basic_streambuf&lt;char&gt;     streambuf;</SPAN><BR>
Libcw is currently not supporting <I>wchar_t</I> because at the time
of writing there is no good libstdc++ available.&nbsp;
This will change in the future.</P>

<A name ="versus"></A>
<H3>2.1.3 Text versus binary</H3>

<P>A function which converts an arbitrary
<I>type</I> into a <I>series</I> of characters is called a <I>serializer</I>.&nbsp;
If this is done in order to store an object of that <I>type</I> to disk for
instance, then no information should be lost, but that is not a condition.&nbsp;
Later it would be possible to <I>restore</I> that object by reading the series
of characters in and translating it back to its original <I>type</I>.&nbsp;
Such a series could be <I>text</I> or it could be <I>binary</I>.&nbsp;
There is no big difference between text and binary, at least
not from a technical point of view.&nbsp; But usually a <I>text</I> representation
is mostly readable and usually doesn't contain the character
<SPAN class="code">'\0'</SPAN>.&nbsp; Moreover, a <I>binary</I> representation will in general
use much fewer bytes then a <I>text</I> representation.</P>

<A name ="inserters"></A>
<H3>2.1.4 Inserters: text representation</H3>

<P>The <I>inserter</I> function
<SPAN class="code">ostream&nbsp;&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;,&nbsp;<I>type</I>)</SPAN>
is a <I>serializer</I>: It converts <I>type</I> into a series of characters
and these characters are written to a <I>streambuf</I>.&nbsp; The role of ostream
is to provide a hook to the streambuf class and to store some information about
how to serialize internal types.&nbsp;
All predefined <SPAN class="code">ostream&amp;&nbsp;operator&lt;&lt;</SPAN> inserters for the internal types convert into a (readable) text
representation. As a programmer you seldom write to the streambuf yourself:
Instead you convert your objects into a representation with internal types
and use existing inserters to write to the streambuf object.&nbsp;
As a result, the inserter functions &lt;&lt; usually serialize into a <I>text</I> representation.&nbsp;
The functions <SPAN class="code">istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;</SPAN> <I>read</I> from a
streambuf and should obviously expect and understand this text
representation.</P>

<A name ="streambuf"></A>
<H3>2.1.5 The<SPAN class="H3code"> streambuf </SPAN>interface</H3>

<P>The interface of a <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN> for reading and writing is purely <I>binary</I>.&nbsp;
A streambuf has functions to read from the <I>get area</I> and functions to write to the <I>put area</I>.&nbsp;
An <I>area</I> is a contiguous block in memory.&nbsp;
The use of areas allows for the option of non-contiguous buffers.&nbsp;
It can consist of multiple memory <I>blocks</I>, or it could be circular for instance.</P>

<A name ="interface design"></A>
<H2>2.2 Interface design of <SPAN class="H2code">dbstreambuf_ct</SPAN></H2>

<P>The normal <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN> object represents a <B>single</B> buffer.&nbsp;
This is not a problem when you are writing to a device that is write-only
(an <SPAN class="code">ostream</SPAN>) or reading from a device that is read-only
(an <SPAN class="code">istream</SPAN>), see figure 1.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20">Figure 1. The interfaces of a single streambuf object as needed
for <SPAN class="code">ostream</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">istream</SPAN> objects.&nbsp;
For instance, for a write-only device the read interface would be used by the device
while the write interface would be used by <SPAN class="code">ostream&amp;</SPAN>
<SPAN class="code">operator&lt;&lt;</SPAN> functions.</P>

<P>A problem occurs when you use an <SPAN class="code">iostream</SPAN>.&nbsp;
An <SPAN class="code">iostream</SPAN> is derived using multiple inheritance,
from <SPAN class="code">ostream</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">istream</SPAN> that share
their virtual base class <SPAN class="code">ios</SPAN> which keeps the pointer to the
<SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN>.&nbsp;
As a result, an <SPAN class="code">iostream</SPAN> uses <B>the same buffer</B> for input <I>and</I> output!
For a device like a non-blocking socket this is disastrous.&nbsp;
This is one of the reasons that libcw needs to define its own streambuf
class: we need two buffers per <SPAN class="code">iostream</SPAN> object.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20">Figure 2. The crosslinked interfaces of two streambuf objects as needed
for <SPAN class="code">iostream</SPAN> objects.&nbsp; The interface of <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN>
1 is used by the operators <SPAN class="code">&lt;&lt;</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">&gt;&gt;</SPAN>
while the interface of <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN> 2 is be used by a device.</P>

<A NAME="buffer design"></A>
<H2>2.3 Buffer design of <SPAN class="H2code">dbstreambuf_ct</SPAN></H2>

<P>The internal buffer is a deque of allocated memory blocks.&nbsp;
Data is written to the last memory block in the deque, until the end of the block is reached.&nbsp;
At that moment a new block is allocated and inserted at the end of the deque.&nbsp;
Note that if the buffer becomes empty the put area is reset to the
beginning of the current block; so if reading keeps pace with writing
then allocation of new blocks is not necessary.</P>

<P>When a new block needs to be allocated then its size is calculated to be the number of unread
bytes stored in the buffer at that moment, rounded up to the nearest typical malloc size.&nbsp;
The latter causes no memory to be wasted.</P>

<P>Data is never moved in memory.&nbsp;
This makes <SPAN class="code">dbstreambuf_ct</SPAN> as fast as possible: All data is at most written once and reading is done
by providing a pointer that points directly into the buffer.&nbsp;
The only exception is when a <I>message</I> is read from the buffer that crosses a block boundary.&nbsp;
In that case a temporal block is allocated and the message is copied to this
block in order to make it contiguous.&nbsp;
Note that by specifying a <I>minimum block size</I> that is significantly
larger than the average message length that will be read, the extra overhead
because of this will be negligible.</P>

<A name ="types"></A>
<H2>2.4 Input, Output and Link buffer</H2>

<P>The reason that the same class is used for both input and output buffering
is that it is easier to maintain: There is no duplicated code.&nbsp;
Having the same interface for input and output buffers turns out to be very confusing however.&nbsp;
Another disadvantage of using the same type for input and output buffers is that they can be confused by accident.&nbsp;
Therefore all methods except the accessors are protected and two new classes are derived from <SPAN class="code">dbstreambuf_ct</SPAN>
that implement a public and more intuitive input and output interface.</P>

<A NAME="interface"></A>
<P>For a correct understanding it is important to realize that the difference between an input and output buffer is purely semantic:
There is no <EM>real</EM> difference between an input buffer and an output buffer.&nbsp;
Only the <EM>interface</EM> has been restricted in order to make the use in its own class less error prone.</P>

<P>There is a third class of buffers that is needed however.&nbsp;
While an input buffer allows to read from a device, it can not write to a device (and vica versa for an output buffer).&nbsp;
Sometimes two devices need to be <EM>linked</EM>:
They need to share the same buffer, one device will write to this buffer while the other device reads from that same buffer.&nbsp;
We will call this type of <EM>buffer interface</EM> a link buffer.</P>

<A NAME="input_buffer_ct"></A>
<H3>2.4.1 <SPAN class="H3code">input_buffer_ct</SPAN></H3>

<P>The <SPAN class="code">input_buffer_ct</SPAN> is used to buffer data that is read from a device.&nbsp;
This means that apart from the normal access to the buffer via
the <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN> virtual functions and
<SPAN class="code">istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;()</SPAN>, we need an interface for
<I>raw</I> read access and an interface that allows the device to
write its data into the buffer.</P>

                                  size_t max_alloc = (size_t)-1)</PRE>
</H5>

<P>This constructs a dynamic, blocks input stream buffer.&nbsp;
The minimum number of allocated bytes for one block of the buffer is <EM>minimum_blocksize</EM>.&nbsp;
The maximum possible number of total allocated bytes of all blocks together is <EM>max_alloc</EM>.&nbsp;
When this value is reached, <EM>overflow()</EM> will return <SPAN class="code">EOF</SPAN>.&nbsp;
The accessor <EM>buffer_full()</EM> returns true when the number of buffered
bytes in the input buffer exceed <EM>buffer_full_watermark</EM>.</P>

<H4>2.4.3.2 The device interface</H4>

<P>The interface of a link buffer uses the same names for its <I>write</I> interface as the
device interface of the <A HREF="#input_buffer_ct::device">input</A> buffer and the same

<P>Returns the true <I>minimum block</I> size in bytes.&nbsp;
This value is not necessarily equal to the value passed to the constructor because its size is optimized for allocation with malloc.</P>

<H5 class="function"><a name="dbstreambuf_ct::used_size"></a>

</H5>

This function returns true when <SPAN class="code">used_size()</SPAN> is larger than
<SPAN class="code">buffer_full_watermark</SPAN> passed to the constructor.&nbsp;
This doesn't mean that writing to the buffer will fail yet, but it should be used to for flow control.&nbsp;

<A name ="fad"></A>
<H2>2.6 Flushing and deleting the buffer</H2>

<A name ="flushing"></A>
<H3>2.6.1 Flushing</H3>

<P>Class <SPAN class="code">streambuf</SPAN> uses the virtual function
<SPAN class="code">sync()</SPAN> to signal the need for flushing the buffer.&nbsp;
This means that <SPAN class="code">sync()</SPAN> should not return
until the buffer is written completely to the associated output device.&nbsp;
While it is obviously a bad idea to use blocking at all in applications
that libcw is aiming at (heavy duty network servers), this synchronizing
is supported nevertheless; mainly for debugging output.</P>

<P>When <SPAN class="code">dbstreambuf_ct::sync()</SPAN> is called,
the buffer needs to call <SPAN class="code">fd_dct::sync()</SPAN>,
a member function of the output device.&nbsp;
Therefore, the buffer needs to know to which output device it is linked, if any.&nbsp;
It would be impractical to pass a pointer to this device object as part of the constructor of the buffer:
That would demand that the output device is created first, which has
consequences that effect the application layer.&nbsp;
Instead, the device pointer can be set with a separate function, which can be hidden from the application layer.&nbsp;
This function is called in <A HREF="traits.html#note">another part</A> of libcw whenever a buffer is assigned to a device.</P>

<A name ="deleting"></A>
<H3>2.6.2 Deleting</H3>

<P>When a buffer isn't used anymore, there is only one logical thing to do: delete it.&nbsp;
A buffer can be used by one device (the input and output buffers) or two devices (the link buffer).&nbsp;
Some sort of garbage collection mechanism is needed to determine when the buffer really isn't used anymore.&nbsp;
Therefore devices need to register with the buffer and release the buffer again when they
are done with it (mostly when the device itself is deleted).</P>

<P>Registration with a buffer is done with the same function call that is
used to pass the device pointer to the buffer; but this time we also need
such a function for input devices! For the sake of symmetry this
function also takes a device pointer.&nbsp;
See &sect;2.6.3 for a definition of these two function calls.</P>

<P>Releasing a buffer is done with the following method:</P>

<H5 class="function"><a name="dbstreambuf_ct::release"></a>
<PRE>bool dbstreambuf_ct::release(fd_dct* device)</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Deletes the buffer when this was the last device using it.&nbsp;
Returns <I>true</I> when the buffer was actually deleted.</P>

<A name ="setting"></A>
<H3>2.6.3 Setting the device pointers</H3>

<P>The device pointers can be set by calling either,</P>

<H5 class="function"><a name="dbstreambuf_ct::set_input_device"></a>
<PRE>void dbstreambuf_ct::set_input_device(fd_dct* device)</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Sets the input device that uses this buffer.&nbsp;
Note that there can be only one input device per buffer, calling this function more then
once results in undefined behaviour.&nbsp;
At this moment, <I>device</I> isn't used, but that might change in the future.</P>

<P>or,</P>

<H5 class="function"><a name="dbstreambuf_ct::set_output_device"></a>
<PRE>void dbstreambuf_ct::set_output_device(fd_dct* device)</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Sets the output device that uses this buffer.&nbsp;
The use of <SPAN class="code">streambuf::sync()</SPAN>
will cause <SPAN class="code"><I>device</I>->sync()</SPAN> to be called.&nbsp;
Note that there can be only one output device per buffer, calling this
function more than once results in undefined behavior.</P>

<A name ="avoid"></A>
<H3>2.6.4 Avoid blocking</H3>

<P>Because <SPAN class="code">sync()</SPAN> is a blocking function, you don't want to use it.&nbsp;
In order to avoid it, you should not use <SPAN class="code">flush</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">endl</SPAN>, nor
call <SPAN class="code">ostream::flush()</SPAN>.</P>

<P class="example">For example, instead of doing</P>

<PRE class="example-code">
myDevice << "Hello World" << endl;	// Write a line with a new-line (and flush it)
myDevice.flush();			// Flush the ostream (?!)
myDevice.del();				// Delete the device object
</PRE>

<P class="example">you should do something like</P>

<PRE class="example-code">
myDevice << "Hello World\n";		// Write a line with a new-line
myDevice.del();				// Causes the device object to be deleted
					// <B>after</B> everything is written out.
</PRE>
