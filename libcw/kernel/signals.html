<H1>Signals</H1>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<A name="intro"></A>
<H2>2.1 Introduction</H2>

<P>Signals are often described as <I>software interrupts</I>.&nbsp;
The kernel of a multitasking Operating System such as
UNIX switches between running applications when either a running application goes to sleep (calls a blocking
system call or enters select(2) or poll(2)) or after a certain period of time (ie. 10 ms).&nbsp;
Signals are handled by the kernel at the moment it switches between running processes, hence the word <I>software</I> interrupts.&nbsp;
Interrupting an application that doesn't go to sleep within 10 ms is performed by a
hardware interrupt though and the program execution can be at any arbitrary point.&nbsp;
When such an application has pending signals, then the signal handler function is called
while the application is in a totally undefined state.&nbsp;
For instance, the application could be in the middle of a call to malloc(3) or free(3), which makes it
dangerous to allocate memory from within a signal handler.</P>

<P>The result of how signals work is that signal handlers can only be allowed to set a flag of a very simple
type: <SPAN class=code">sig_atomic_t</SPAN> (often an <SPAN class=code">int</SPAN>).&nbsp;
This fact gives signals their <B>real</B> meaning:
Signals are a way of <I>communication</I> between processes or between the kernel and a process.&nbsp;
Signals fall in the category of IPC (Inter Process Communication), just like pipes and UNIX sockets.&nbsp;
For a correct understanding of signals one has to see them as <I>messages</I>, not as interrupts.</P>

<P>And like with messages received via a socket, there is no accurate timing possible - not without a Real Time kernel.</P>

<A name="signal event server"></A>
<H2>2.2 The signal(7) event server</H2>

<H5 class="function"><a name="SignalServer"></a>
<PRE>SignalServer</PRE></H5>

<P>Libcw treats signals as <A HREF="../events/toc.html">events</A>.&nbsp;
The <A HREF="../events/design.html#event server">event server</A>
for signals is a <A HREF="../global/global.html#Singleton">singleton</A>, its instance can be accessed through the static method
<SPAN class="code">SignalServer::<A HREF="../global/global.html#Singleton::instance">instance</A>()</SPAN>.&nbsp;
The <I>signal event server</I> accepts <A HREF="../events/interface.html#request data">request data</A> of type
<A HREF="#SignalRequestData"><SPAN class="code">SignalRequestData</SPAN></A>.</P>

<P>The <I>signal event server</I> uses sigaction(2) to turn on and off handling of signals.&nbsp;
Handling is turned on when events are requested and turned off when the last request is removed.&nbsp;
Note that <EM>before</EM> any event request a signal is handled by its default handler
(<SPAN class="code">SIG_DFL</SPAN>), while after the last event request is removed, the signal is ignored
(<SPAN class="code">SIG_IGN</SPAN>).<P>

<P>A single handler is used for all signals, counting the total number of signals
occurred as well as the number of occurrances <EM>per</EM> signal.&nbsp;
Signal events are dispatched from the main loop.&nbsp;
The number of times a specific signal occurred in between two such main loop checks is passed as part of
the <A HREF="#SignalData"><SPAN class="code">SignalData</SPAN></A> to the
<A HREF="../events/design.html#event client">event client</A>.</P>

<P>As with all <A HREF="../events/toc.html">events</A>, a <A HREF="../events/design.html#busy interface">busy interface</A>
and/or a <A HREF="../events/design.html#cookies">cookie</A> can be passed to the
<A HREF="#signalRequest"><SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN></A> call as needed
(see also chapter Events <A HREF="../events/interface.html#event_data_server_tct">&sect;2.2.6</A>).</P>

<A NAME="requesting"></A>
<H2>2.3 Requesting signal events</H2>

<A NAME="SignalRequestData"></A>
<H3>2.3.1 <SPAN class="H3code">SignalRequestData</SPAN></H3>

<H5 class="function"><a name="SignalRequestData::SignalRequestData"></a>
<PRE>SignalRequestData::SignalRequestData (int sig, int flags = 0)</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Constructs a signal request object.</P>

<P><SPAN class="para">sig</SPAN> is the requested signal.</P>

<P><SPAN class="para">flags</SPAN> specifies a set of flags which modify the behavior of the signal handling process.&nbsp;
It is formed by  the  bit-wise OR of zero or more of the following:</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=20>
</TD>
<TD>
<SPAN class="code">sigOneShot</SPAN>
</TD>
<TD>:</TD>
<TD WIDTH=400>
Remove the request after it is being handled.&nbsp;
The callback function will be called only once.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD>
<SPAN class="code">sigReplace</SPAN>
</TD>
<TD>:</TD>
<TD WIDTH=400>
For each signal type <SPAN class="para">sig</SPAN>, there can be only one request with this flag set.&nbsp;
Each new request with <SPAN class="code">sigReplace</SPAN> set causes
the previous request to be removed.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="signalRequest"></A>
<H3>2.3.2 The <SPAN class="H3code">signalRequest</SPAN> macro</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="../events/interface.html">event interface</A> uses
<A HREF="../events/interface.html#event_data_server_tct"><SPAN class="code">operator()</SPAN></A> to register event requests.&nbsp;
Because the signal server is a <A HREF="../global/global.html#Singleton">singleton</A>,
one must use the rather obnoxious looking code
(where <SPAN class="code">Foo::foo</SPAN> is an event client and <SPAN class="code">Foo::gotSIGHUP(SignalType const&amp;)</SPAN>
the callback function)</P>

<PRE class="code">
  (SignalServer::instance())(SignalRequestData(SIGHUP), foo, &amp;Foo::gotSIGHUP);
</PRE>

<P>In order to make such expressions more readable, libcw defines the macro <SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN></P>

<PRE class="code">
#define signalRequest (SignalServer::instance())
</PRE>

<P>allowing the developer to request signal notifications with better looking code</P>

<PRE class="code">
  signalRequest(SignalRequestData(SIGHUP), foo, &amp;Foo::gotSIGHUP);
</PRE>

<P class="example">For example, suppose you want your application class <SPAN class="code">MyApplication</SPAN> to handle
the signals <SPAN class="code">SIGINT</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">SIGHUP</SPAN>.&nbsp;
Then you could request the signal server to notify you by calling:</P>

<PRE class="example-code">
  signalRequest(SignalRequestData(SIGINT, sigOneShot|sigReplace),
      MyApplication::instance(), &amp;MyApplication::handle_signal);

  signalRequest(SignalRequestData(SIGHUP),
      MyApplication::instance(), &amp;MyApplication::handle_signal);
</PRE>

<P class="example">where the callback function must be declared as</P>

<PRE class="example-code">
void MyApplication::handle_signal(SignalType const&amp;);
</PRE>

<A NAME="macro"></A>
<P>Note that instead of the macro we could have created a global reference for the server with</P>

<PRE class="code">
  SignalServer&amp; signalRequest(SignalServer::instantiate());
</PRE>

<P>However, this solution has a pitfall: You don't know in what order global objects are initialized
(click <A HREF="../global/global.html#fiasco">here</A> for more info).&nbsp;
Using this global reference, the compiler assumes that it is initialized and uses its value without checking it.&nbsp;
That means that this would coredump when a signal is requested from the constructor
of a global object that is initialized first.&nbsp;
Therefore you shouldn't use such a reference from global constructors, but instead
<SPAN class="code">(SignalServer::instantiate())</SPAN>.</P>

<P>In this sense, the reference is equivalent with <SPAN class="code">SignalServer::instance()</SPAN> (also this function
returns a reference without checking if it is initialized, see chapter <A HREF="../global/global.html">Global Objects Management</A>)
except for the order of initialization: it is possible that using the reference <EM>does</EM>
work on one operating system, but doesn't work on another and vica versa.&nbsp;
The relevant difference however is that the macro <SPAN class="code">DEBUGGLOBAL</SPAN> enables checks
for &laquo;static initialization order fiasco&raquo; errors when
<SPAN class="code">SignalServer::instance()</SPAN> is used, but would not catch such an error when the <EM>reference</EM>
<SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN> is used in a global constructor (and is initialized first by coincidence).&nbsp;
This is why using the reference is bad.</P>

<P>So now we have to choose between the following solutions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Use the reference nevertheless and simply hope that signals won't be requested from global constructors.</LI>
<LI>Let the user use <SPAN class="code">(SignalServer::instance())</SPAN> all the time, hoping that they won't
create a reference themselfs and fall in the pit that way.</LI>
<LI>Change the type of <SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN> when <SPAN class="code">DEBUGGLOBAL</SPAN> is defined,
and do some special trick in that case.</LI>
<LI>Duplicate the <SPAN class="code">operator()</SPAN> code from the <A HREF="../events/interface.html#Classes defined by libcw">Events</A>
section and build in the needed checks especially for this <SPAN class="code">SignalServer</SPAN> case.</LI>
<LI>Use a macro for <SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Duplicating code and changing (proto)types as function of debugging macros are absolutely evil.&nbsp;
Therefore we have only one solution left: use a macro for <SPAN class="code">signalRequest</SPAN>.</P>

<P>The disadvantages of this macro are considered less serious than the disadvantages of the other solutions.</P>

<A NAME="receiving"></A>
<H2>2.4 Receiving signal events</H2>

<A NAME="SignalData"></A>
<H3>2.4.1 <SPAN class="H3code">class SignalData</SPAN></H3>

<P>The <A HREF="#SignalType">event type</A> reference that is passed as a parameter to the callback function
(the &laquo;<SPAN class="code">Foo::gotSIGHUP</SPAN>&raquo; above), is <EM>derived</EM> from <SPAN class="code">class SignalData</SPAN>.</P>

<H5 class="function">
<PRE>int SignalData::get_signal(void) const</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Returns the signal that needs handling.&nbsp;
This is only interesting when using the same callback function for more than one signal, of course.</P>

<H5 class="function">
<PRE>sig_atomic_t SignalData::get_count(void) const</PRE>
</H5>

<P>Returns the number of times the signal occurred since the last time a callback
function for this signal was called (or since any signal event request was received).&nbsp;
This value will usually be 1 unless the application is being flooded with the signal
faster then it could return to the main loop.</P>

<A NAME="SignalType"></A>
<H3>2.4.2 <SPAN class="H3code">class SignalType</SPAN></H3>

<P>This is the unique <A HREF="../events/interface.html#EventType">event type</A> of <SPAN class="code">SignalServer</SPAN> which
is passed to the callback function.&nbsp;
It is derived from <A HREF="#SignalData"><SPAN class="code">SignalData</SPAN></A> and doesn't have any extra data or methods.</P>

<P class="example">For example, the callback function <SPAN class="code">handle_signal</SPAN> from the previous
example could be defined like:</P>

<PRE class="example-code">
void MyApplication::handle_signal(SignalType const&amp; signal_type)
{
  switch(signal_type.get_signal())
  {
    case SIGHUP:
      Dout( dc::notice, "Received SIGHUP " << signal_type.get_count() << " times." );
      break;
    case SIGINT:
      fd_dct::terminate_when_done();
      break;
  }
}
</PRE>

<P class="example">Note that the usage of <SPAN class="code">sigOneShot</SPAN> in the request for SIGINT
guarantees that <SPAN class="code">terminate_when_done()</SPAN> will only be called once.&nbsp;
While the usage of the flag <SPAN class="code">sigReplace</SPAN> means that if later a new request for SIGINT is
made by any other object, this one will be removed.</P>

<A NAME="default"></A>
<H2>2.5 Default signal handling</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="application.html">application</A> base class <A HREF="application.html#base class"><SPAN class="code">libcw_app_tct</SPAN></A>
initializes a few default signal handlers with the following effects:</P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN class="code">SIGTERM </SPAN>always causes <SPAN class="code">fd_dct::terminate_when_done()</SPAN>
to be called.</LI>

<LI><SPAN class="code">SIGINT </SPAN>causes <SPAN class="code">fd_dct::return_when_done(-1)</SPAN>
to be called (causing <SPAN class="code">mainloop()</SPAN> to return with value <SPAN class="code">-1</SPAN>).&nbsp;
The request for this signal uses the flags <SPAN class="code">sigOneShot|SigReplace</SPAN> so it can
easily be overridden with a new request.</LI>

<LI>The handler for <SPAN class="code">SIGPIPE </SPAN>does nothing.&nbsp;
It is necessary though to make sure the signal is never ignored.&nbsp;
Therefore, this signal handler does <EM>not</EM> use the <SPAN class="code">sigOneShot</SPAN>
or <SPAN class="code">SigReplace</SPAN> flags, making it sticky.</LI>

<LI><SPAN class="code">SIGCHLD </SPAN>causes the application to call <SPAN class="code">waitpid(2)</SPAN>
by default in order to avoid zombie processes.&nbsp;
Also here the flag <SPAN class="code">SigReplace</SPAN> is used to allow overriding.</LI>
