<div class="textblock">We already covered a great deal about groups in the chapter theory_cyclic.&amp;nbsp; But well, those were Abelian.&#160; What about non-Abelian groups?About the most general way to think about algebraic systems is by thinking about matrices.&#160; A set of <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrices filled with real numbers covers about anything except pure noise (at least, in my opinion).&#160; Yes, real numbers, because also the complex numbers can be covered with it.&#160; Lets do that as a first exercise.Consider the set of matrices,<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ F = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a \\ \end{pmatrix} \,\vert\, a \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \]" src="form_1036_210.png" width="129" height="31"/>
</p>
then this set is obviously isomorphic with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{R}$" src="form_1036_211.png" width="10" height="10"/> ( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$F \cong \mathbb{R}$" src="form_1036_212.png" width="35" height="10"/>) and therefore it is a field itself.&#160; I will assume you are familiar with the rules of multiplying matrices, so check for yourself that this set of <span class="formula">2 <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1036_59.png"/> 2</span> matrices behaves exactly like ordinary real numbers.&#160; Please note that the multiplicative identity is the matrix where <span class="formula">a = 1</span>, and the additive identity is the matrix where <span class="formula">a = 0</span>.&#160; We will use that without further notice below, so don't get confused.Next, lets extend the field <span class="formula">F</span> by adjoining a <span class="formula">t</span> to it:<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ K = F(t) \]" src="form_1036_213.png" width="51" height="14"/>
</p>
Hey, I can't help it, that is the way to write that you extend a field with some new element and all elements that naturally follow from it in order to make the field closed again.&#160; Note that adjoining an element to a <em>ring</em> is written <span class="formula">R[t]</span>, using <em>square brackets</em>. We can also speak about the field extension <span class="formula">K : F</span>, and write the extension degree as <span class="formula">m = [K : F]</span>.&#160; Its just a new notation that I thought I'd throw in, we did this <a class="el" href="group__theory__polynomial.html">before</a>.However, in this case we don't specify a reduction polynomial for <span class="formula">t</span> but instead we specify exactly what it is:<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1036_214.png" width="73" height="31"/>
</p>
That doesn't mean that there isn't a reduction polynomial however.&#160; It is easy to verify that<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t^2 + \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1036_215.png" width="126" height="31"/>
</p>
so the left hand side of that equation is the reduction polynomial (it is irreducible).&#160; As you will have noticed, the square of <span class="formula">t</span> is equal to the additive inverse of the multiplicative identity:<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1036_216.png" width="213" height="31"/>
</p>
And therefore we can identify <span class="formula">t</span> with the complex number <span class="formula">i</span> and establish that <span class="formula">K = F(t)</span> is isomorphic with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{C}$" src="form_1036_217.png" width="10" height="10"/>.<hr  />
Ok, back to arbitrary <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrices.&#160; When the matrix isn't square (<span class="formula">n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> m</span>) then you can't multiply them.&#160; You can still add them, but that isn't very interesting - that would be something isomorphic with a <span class="formula">nm</span> dimensional vectorspace and that is not what we want to investigate (we are not investigating matrices, we just use them as example), so forget about adding for now.&#160; Of course you'd still be able to multiply a <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrix with a <span class="formula">MxN</span> matrix, but putting matrices of different shape into a set will never form a group because in a group (where the binary operator is multiplication) you need to be able to multiply any two elements.&#160; In other words, we are only interested in <em>square</em> <span class="formula">NxN</span> matrices.Actually, we are only interested in <em>finite</em> groups (so I guess the title of this chapter is a bit misleading).&#160; That means we can also put a restrictions on the elements of the matrices: the elements of the matrices are finite (unit) rings (like <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}_n$" src="form_1036_218.png" width="15" height="13"/> for some <span class="formula">n &gt; 0</span> in <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{N}$" src="form_1036_13.png"/>).&#160; A ring is set of elements for which addition, subtraction (additive inverse) exists and multiplication is defined and algebraically closed (the result of such an operation stays inside the ring) but not division because not all elements necessarily have a multiplicative inverse.&#160; A <em>unit</em> ring is a ring with a multiplicative identity in it (1) and I like that because I insist to be able to construct identity matrix for our group that looks a bit familiar.Another axiom of groups is that there must exist an inverse for every element.&#160; Therefore we need to restrict ourself to matrices that have inverses.&#160; Note that this means that a matrix with all zeroes is not an element of our group!&#160; That's ok, we don't need it: we don't have an addition operator, so we don't need the additive identity (which is what zero is).Karl Dahlke owns a wonderful <a href="http://www.mathreference.com">site</a>, a must for your bookmarks, with a large collection of lectures on many mathematical topics.&#160; Below you will find a copy of his chapters on <a href="http://www.mathreference.com/grp,intro.html">Group Theory</a>, reproduced almost literally here with his permission.&#160; Then each paragraph is followed by a block of text from my hand, clearly marked with a different background color.&#160; My main goal with those extra sections is to provide (additional) examples, and sometimes clarifications.<a class="anchor" id="agroup"></a> <DIV class="karl"><table width="100%"><tr><td>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> If you haven't seen cosets before, group theory can be a difficult place to start.&#160; (It's so abstract).&#160; Let me explain the idea of a coset in more general terms.Let <span class="formula">h</span> be a substructure inside <span class="formula">g</span>.&#160; Shifted copies of <span class="formula">h</span> are called cosets of <span class="formula">h</span>, and they cover all of <span class="formula">g</span> without overlap.&#160; For example, let <span class="formula">g</span> be the xy plane and let <span class="formula">h</span> be the x axis.&#160; For every real number <span class="formula">c</span>, the line running parallel to the x axis, through <span class="formula">y = c</span>, is a coset of the x axis.&#160; These cosets cover the entire plane without overlap.The quotient <span class="formula">g/h</span> is the collection of cosets.&#160; In this example, the quotient is really (isomorphic with) the y axis.With this in mind, let's build cosets of the subgroup <span class="formula">h</span> inside the group <span class="formula">g</span>.Given a subgroup <span class="formula">h</span>, the right coset of an element <span class="formula">x</span> is the set of elements <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\cdot$" src="form_1036_49.png"/>x</span>.&#160; Left cosets are defined similarly, i.e. <span class="formula">x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\cdot$" src="form_1036_49.png"/>h</span>.If <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> are in <span class="formula">h</span>, and <span class="formula">ax = bx</span>, then cancel <span class="formula">x</span>, and <span class="formula">a = b</span>.&#160; All the elements in a coset are distinct.&#160; there are <span class="formula">|h|</span> of them.In fact the elements of any given coset, left or right, correspond one-on-one with the elements of <span class="formula">h</span>.Thanks to the identity in <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">x</span> is always in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (reflexivity).&#160; Since we can always multiply by the inverse of an element in <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">x</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> iff <span class="formula">y</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (symmetry).&#160; If <span class="formula">z</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">z</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (transitivity).&#160; In other words, <span class="formula">y = ax</span> and <span class="formula">z = by</span>, hence <span class="formula">z = bax</span>.&#160; We have an equivalence relation, and <span class="formula">g</span> can be partitioned into well defined cosets.&#160; These cosets have the same size, or cardinality, namely <span class="formula">|h|</span>. 
</DIV>
<DIV class="me">
 The above means that if you have some <span class="formula">a</span> that is an element of the subgroup <span class="formula">h</span> of <span class="formula">g</span>, then multiplying <span class="formula">a</span> with any element <span class="formula">x</span> of <span class="formula">g</span> causes the result to be part of a coset of <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; When <span class="formula">x</span> is also in <span class="formula">h</span>, then the result is also again in <span class="formula">h</span> of course, and the coset is really just <span class="formula">h</span> itself.&#160; It gets more interestingly when you multiply with some <span class="formula">x</span> that is not in <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; The result will be that you get a complete copy of <span class="formula">h</span>, of the same size, none of whose elements are in <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; Moreover, you could have multiplied with <em>any</em> element of this coset and you'd have gotten the same coset: each element of the coset is thus a representative for that coset.&#160; It follows also trivially that there are in total <span class="formula">|g| / |h|</span> cosets of <span class="formula">h</span>.For example, let us multiply each element of <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span> with some <span class="formula">x</span> not in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>.&#160; Without changing the order in the coset, this will be the element that becomes below the identity then (reflexivity).<p class="formulaDsp">

</p>
Note that this <em>does</em> overlap (the first element) with the right coset.If we had picked any other element of the right-coset <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span> that we found, it would have generated the same coset.&#160; For example,<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ H_6 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 2 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \]" src="form_1036_237.png" width="400" height="31"/>
</p>
which is indeed the same coset as <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span>.By picking yet another element of <span class="formula">G</span>, that is not in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span> nor in <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span>, we can generate another right coset with 6 new elements, etcetera.&#160; Since there are 48 elements in <span class="formula">G</span> and 6 elements in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>, we will be able to generate in total 8 distinct right-cosets from <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>, each with 6 different elements, until all of <span class="formula">G</span> is covered.Finally note that these cosets are <em>not</em> groups, they don't even contain the identity element.&#160; However, cosets can act as group elements themselfs.&#160; Consider a set <span class="formula">S</span> of <em>cosets</em> of a subgroup <span class="formula">H</span> of a group <span class="formula">G</span>.&#160; Then we know that each coset has the same number of elements and that any element of <span class="formula">G</span> occurs only in one of the cosets.&#160; We can write a coset of <span class="formula">H</span> represented by some <span class="formula">x</span> in <span class="formula">G</span> as:<p class="formulaDsp">

or in short<p class="formulaDsp">

</p>
As said before, any <span class="formula">x</span> element of this particular coset will lead to the same coset.We can write the set of all cosets of <span class="formula">H</span> as:<p class="formulaDsp">

As you can see, <span class="formula">N</span> acts as the identity element here.&#160; Let me make clear how this works by working out the details again like I did in the paragraph about cosets above.Let <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> O</span> be a cosrep of <span class="formula">O</span> so that <span class="formula">O = o<sub>1</sub>N</span>.&#160; Furthermore note that we can take any <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> N</span> be the cosrep of <span class="formula">N</span>, so also the identity matrix <span class="formula">e</span>: <span class="formula">N = eN</span>.&#160; Then, for any coset <span class="formula">A = aN</span> of <span class="formula">N</span> we have that <span class="formula">AN = aeN = aN = A</span>.&#160; And likewise <span class="formula">NA = eaN = aN = A.</span>&#160; It isn't needed that <span class="formula">N</span> is a <em>normal</em> subgroup for <em>that</em>.The only interesting case is therefore <span class="formula">O<sup>2</sup></span>.<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ O \cdot O = \left\{ o_1h_1 \cdot o_1h_2 \,\vert\, h_1,h_2 \in N \right\} \]" src="form_1036_251.png" width="181" height="14"/>
</p>
Because <span class="formula">N</span> is normal, the left and right cosets coincide and there will exist some <span class="formula">o<sub>3</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> O</span> such that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub> = h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>3</sub></span>.&#160; Realize that in general <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>1</sub></span>!&#160; And because <span class="formula">h<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub></span> is again an element of <span class="formula">N</span>, lets say <span class="formula">h</span>, there will also exist some <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> O</span> such that <span class="formula">h<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>3</sub> = ho<sub>3</sub> = o<sub>2</sub>h</span> and we see that<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ O \cdot O = \left\{ o_1o_2h \,\vert\, h \in N \right\} \]" src="form_1036_252.png" width="129" height="14"/>
</p>
Now whatever coset of <span class="formula">N</span> this is, it is fixed of course, independent of the choice of <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span>.&#160; It is easy to see that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub></span> cannot be an element of <span class="formula">O</span>.&#160; Because, suppose that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> = o <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> O</span>, then there must exist a <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> N</span> such that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h = o</span> from which follows that <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span> would be in <span class="formula">N</span> and it isn't.&#160; Therefore <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\notin$" src="form_1036_253.png" width="8" height="14"/> O</span>.&#160; Now, in our case, the only thing outside <span class="formula">O</span> is <span class="formula">N</span>, hence <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> N</span> for any two matrices <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span> in <span class="formula">O</span> and thus <img class="formulaInl" alt="$O \cdot O = N$" src="form_1036_254.png" width="56" height="10"/>.More in general, we can derive that<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ A \cdot B = \left\{ abh \,\vert\, h \in N \right\} = (ab)N \]" src="form_1036_255.png" width="169" height="14"/>
</p>
when <span class="formula">N</span> is a normal subgroup and <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> are cosreps of respectively <span class="formula">A</span> and <span class="formula">B</span>.&#160; The parenthesis are redundant, but it shows that the result is again a coset of <span class="formula">N</span>, and thus that this operation on the cosets of <span class="formula">N</span> is closed.&#160; But I am actually going on ahead of Karl Dahlke's lectures here.&#160; Lets move on to his next paragraph. </DIV> <a class="anchor" id="kernelsandquotients"></a> <DIV class="karl"><table width="100%"><tr><td>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> When the subgroup <span class="formula">h</span> is normal, the cosets form their own group.&#160; The product of two cosets is found by multiplying any two cosreps together, and taking that coset.&#160; We need to prove this is well defined, i.e. you always get the same coset no matter which cosreps you select.&#160; If, instead of <span class="formula">xy</span>, we had selected <span class="formula">xuyv</span>, where <span class="formula">u</span> and <span class="formula">v</span> come from <span class="formula">h</span>, we replace <span class="formula">uy</span> with <span class="formula">yw</span>, since the left and right cosets of <span class="formula">y</span> are the same.&#160; Now <span class="formula">wv</span> lives in <span class="formula">h</span>, so we have found another member in the same coset, the coset of <span class="formula">xy</span>.&#160; We needed <span class="formula">h</span> to be normal, to replace <span class="formula">uy</span> with <span class="formula">yw</span>.The identity represents the identity coset, and a coset's inverse is found by inverting one of its cosreps.&#160; The resulting group of cosets is called the quotient group, or the factor group, and <span class="formula">h</span> is called the kernel.&#160; In fact, we will now switch notation, whence <span class="formula">k</span> is the kernel and <span class="formula">h</span> is the quotient group.&#160; Hope this isn't too confusing.You'll notice that the quotient retains the coarse structure of the group, without all the fine detail; like looking at an object through the wrong end of a telescope.&#160; <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>15</sub></span> has a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">{0, 5, 10}</span>, and a quotient group with cosreps 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, i.e. <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>5</sub></span>.&#160; The quotient tells us that the original group has some similarity to the integers mod 5; the kernel tells us the group has something to do with <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>3</sub></span>.&#160; Of course we could have used <span class="formula">{0, 3, 6, 9, 12}</span> as kernel, making <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>3</sub></span> the quotient.&#160; We don't always have the option to switch kernel and quotient, but in this case we do.If <span class="formula">g</span> consists of the powers of a generator <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">g</span> is cyclic.&#160; The only cyclic groups are the integers and the integers mod n, for all positive values of n.&#160; The finite cyclic groups are denoted <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>n</sub></span>.&#160; These groups are simple iff <span class="formula">n</span> is prime.&#160; If <span class="formula">n = pq</span>, <span class="formula">g</span> can have the factor group <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span> or <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>q</sub></span>, as demonstrated by <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>15</sub></span> above. </DIV><DIV class="me">The above repeats more or less what I've already said before, except that it introduces two new names: the normal subgroup is called <em>kernel</em> (from now on denoted with <span class="formula">K</span>) and the set of cosets of this kernel, which form a group by themselfs thus, is called <em>quotient</em>.&#160; This quotient is also be denoted with <span class="formula">G/K</span> in literature.&#160; That notation is slightly counter intuitive as it gives one the feeling that the result is something smaller than <span class="formula">G</span>, and one wouldn't expect <span class="formula">K</span> itself to be an element of this quotient either.&#160; But in fact, the quotient group <span class="formula">G/K</span> is just the set of all cosets of <span class="formula">K</span> within <span class="formula">G</span>, including the identity coset <span class="formula">K</span> itself.&#160; And all cosets together still cover all of <span class="formula">G</span>.&#160; The number of elements in <span class="formula">G/K</span> however is exactly equal to <span class="formula">|G/K| = |G|/|K|</span>, which makes the use of the slash a bit more logical.Another notation found in literature for the cyclic groups <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>n</sub></span> (the integers ( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/>) modulo <span class="formula">n</span>) is <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}/$" src="form_1036_256.png" width="15" height="14"/>n</span>.&#160; Which is in fact a quotient group.&#160; Therefore, in this case we have <span class="formula">G = <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/></span> and we expect <span class="formula">n</span> to be some normal subgroup of <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/>.&#160; In fact, <span class="formula">n</span> is just a cosrep; and the subgroup of <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> that it is refering to is <span class="formula">n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/></span> which are all integers divisable by <span class="formula">n</span>.&#160; This is trivially a <em>normal</em> subgroup because <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> is Abelian.&#160; Of course, one also sees the notation <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}/$" src="form_1036_256.png" width="15" height="14"/>n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/></span> frequently used in literature.&#160; This quotient then exists of all cosets of <span class="formula">n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/></span>,<p class="formulaDsp">

Please note that while we use multiplication for the matrices, and for the general theory in Karls lectures, the group operator of the integers <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> is <em>addition</em>!&#160; The cosets in <span class="formula">{x + n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> | x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/>}</span> have a natural set of cosreps, namely those values of <span class="formula">x</span> for which <span class="formula">0 <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\leq$" src="form_1036_18.png"/> x &lt; n</span>.&#160; Moreover, those cosets form a group that is <em>isomorphic</em> with <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>n</sub></span>.&#160; They're thus not the <em>exact</em> same thing.There is another nice example that gives insight.&#160; Again this example is Abelian, unfortunately, but still worth remembering.&#160; Consider vectors in a 2D plane through the origin.&#160; They form a group under the operation of <em>addition</em>.&#160; The origin is the identity element, inverses are vectors with the same length but pointing in opposite direction and adding any two vectors in the plane will result again in a vector in that same plane, etc.&#160; Now, in 3D space, take a vector <span class="formula">x</span> that is not an element of this plane, but instead an element of the rest of the 3D space (this 3D space is our <span class="formula">G</span>, which obviously also a group).&#160; The plane through the origin (<span class="formula">K</span>) is thus a (normal) subgroup of the 3D space (it is trivially normal because this is Abelian).&#160; Adding the vector <span class="formula">x</span> to the plane results in a plane <em>not</em> going through the origin, but parallel to the orignal plane.&#160; This new plane, <span class="formula">x + K</span>, is a coset of the original plane <span class="formula">K</span>.&#160; The complete set of cosets of <span class="formula">K</span>, <span class="formula">G/K</span>, fills all of the 3D space, all of <span class="formula">G</span>.&#160; All those planes together form a group that are isomorphic with a group of just a set of cosreps of those planes, for example, a line perpendicular to the planes (although any straight line would do).&#160; This line is indeed again a group, as <span class="formula">G/K</span> should be.&#160; Moreover, in this case we can, as was explained in the example of Karl too, exchange the kernel and the quotient: we can take any line as kernel (because, since this is Abelian, also the line is a normal subgroup) and observe that the quotient with this line is isomorphic with a plane through the origin. </DIV> <a class="anchor" id="homomorphismsandisomorphisms"></a> <DIV class="karl"><table width="100%"><tr><td>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> Taken from an old Greek word for shape, the various &quot;morphisms&quot; preserve the structure of a group, or at least part of its structure.&#160; Actually these terms are applied to many different objects, not just groups.&#160; If an object is based on a set, with one or more operators that define that object, and a function <span class="formula">f</span> maps this set to another set, and <span class="formula">f</span> preserves the defining operators, then <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism.&#160; Rings and fields have two operators that must commute with <span class="formula">f</span>; groups have only one.&#160; Let's look at a simple example.Let <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> be the group of integers under addition and let <span class="formula">f</span> map <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> onto <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> mod 7.&#160; Note that we can take <span class="formula">x+y mod 7</span>, and that's the same as taking <span class="formula">x mod 7</span> and adding it to <span class="formula">y mod 7</span> (and then again doing the result mod 7).&#160; In other words, <span class="formula">f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)</span>.&#160; That's it; that's all we need for a group homomorphism.Every normal subgroup defines a group homomorphism.&#160; If <span class="formula">k</span> is a normal subgroup, and <span class="formula">h</span> the resulting quotient group, let the function <span class="formula">f</span> take an element <span class="formula">x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1036_4.png"/> g</span> to the coset of <span class="formula">k</span> represented by <span class="formula">x</span> ( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$f: x \mapsto xk$" src="form_1036_259.png" width="58" height="13"/>).&#160; As described in the previous section, <span class="formula">f</span> is a function from <span class="formula">g</span> onto <span class="formula">h</span>, where <span class="formula">g</span> and <span class="formula">h</span> are both groups; but is <span class="formula">f</span> a homomorphism?&#160; Does <span class="formula">f</span> commute with the multiplication operator?&#160; Well the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> times the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> is, by its very definition, the coset of <span class="formula">xy</span>.&#160; Thus <span class="formula">f</span> is a group homomorphism.Conversely, suppose <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism from the group <span class="formula">g</span> onto the set <span class="formula">h</span>, which possesses a preexisting operator <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1036_59.png"/>.&#160; Since <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism, <span class="formula">f(x) <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1036_59.png"/>f(y) = f(x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1036_59.png"/>y)</span>.&#160; In other words, <span class="formula">f</span> commutes with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1036_59.png"/>.&#160; It is not hard to show that <span class="formula">h</span> is a group, inheriting all the group properties through <span class="formula">f</span>.&#160; If <span class="formula">g</span> were a ring, <span class="formula">h</span> would be a ring, and so on.Let <span class="formula">1</span> (the identity) in <span class="formula">g</span> map to an element we will call <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, and verify that <span class="formula">1</span> acts as an identity element in <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; That is, <span class="formula">f(1)f(x) = f(1x) = f(x)</span>, hence <span class="formula">1</span> leaves <span class="formula">h</span> where it is.Let <span class="formula">k</span> be the set of elements in <span class="formula">g</span> that map to <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; For any <span class="formula">x</span> and <span class="formula">y</span> in <span class="formula">k</span>, <span class="formula">f(x) = f(y) = 1 in h</span>.&#160; Their product is <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, hence <span class="formula">f(xy) = 1</span>, hence <span class="formula">xy</span> is still in <span class="formula">k</span>.&#160; Inverses must also map to <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, and are present in <span class="formula">k</span>, hence <span class="formula">k</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>.It is easy to show that <span class="formula">xk/x</span> remains in <span class="formula">k</span>, as <span class="formula">f(xk/x) = 1</span>, hence <span class="formula">k</span> is a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>.Finally, the elements of <span class="formula">h</span> correspond to the cosets of <span class="formula">k</span>, and are multiplied acccordingly.&#160; The image group <span class="formula">h</span> is indistinguishable from the quotient group <span class="formula">g/k</span>.&#160; A group homomorphism defines, and is defined by, a normal subgroup and quotient group.If the kernel of a homomorphism is the identity element, <span class="formula">f</span> is a monomorphism.&#160; This comes from the Greek word mono, meaning one; the map is one-on-one.If <span class="formula">f</span> carries <span class="formula">g</span> onto the entire group <span class="formula">h</span>, rather than a piece of <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">f</span> is an epimorphism.&#160; This is usually what we mean when we say <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> to <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; Sometimes we say <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> &quot;onto&quot; <span class="formula">h</span> - same thing.&#160; If <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> &quot;into&quot; <span class="formula">h</span>, it is not always an epimorphism.&#160; Take the integers mod 7, then multiply by 2.&#160; This maps <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/> onto the even numbers mod 14.&#160; It is a group homomorphism into <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>14</sub></span>, but it is not an epimorphism, because nothing maps to the odd numbers.If <span class="formula">f</span> is an epimorphism and a monomorphism it is an isomorphism.&#160; Elements map one-on-one, and all of <span class="formula">g</span> maps to all of <span class="formula">h</span>.&#160; The map can be reversed to produce an inverse homomorphism.&#160; The two groups are indistinguishable.&#160; We have merely assigned different labels to the elements of <span class="formula">g</span>.&#160; Some people would say these are in fact the same group; where the structure defines the group, without regard to the underlying set.&#160; This abstract definition is valid, because group isomorphism is an equivalence relation.&#160; We can clump all the isomorphic groups together and declare them a single group.For example, if <span class="formula">p</span> is prime there is only one group (structure) of order <span class="formula">p</span>, namely <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span>.&#160; Let <span class="formula">x</span> be an element, other than <span class="formula">1</span>, of some group <span class="formula">g</span> with <span class="formula">p</span> elements, and consider the powers of <span class="formula">x</span>.&#160; If <span class="formula">x<sup>n</sup></span> becomes <span class="formula">1</span> before <span class="formula">n</span> reaches <span class="formula">p</span>, then <span class="formula">x</span> generates a proper subgroup, which is forbidden by <a class="el" href="group__theory__grouptheory.html#lagrange">Lagrange's theorem</a>.&#160;

Since <span class="formula">r</span> consists of finite products from <span class="formula">h</span> and <span class="formula">k</span>, all of <span class="formula">r</span> is represented by these triples.If two triples lead to the same element, i.e. <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>1</sub>j<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>2</sub>j<sub>2</sub></span>, multiply by <span class="formula">x<sub>2</sub></span> inverse on the left.&#160;

Divide these out, leaving elements in <span class="formula">k</span>.Now <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub> = y<sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="formula">j<sub>1</sub> = j<sub>2</sub></span>, and the triples were in fact the same.&#160; Elements of <span class="formula">r</span> correspond one on one with triples drawn from <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">y</span>, and <span class="formula">j</span>.If <span class="formula">r</span> is finite, the order of <span class="formula">r</span> is <span class="formula">|h|*|k|/|j|</span>.Don't assume you can just multiply components together.&#160; After all, <span class="formula">r</span> is not a direct product.&#160; When we pull elements past each other, <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub></span> is replaced with <span class="formula">y<sub>3</sub></span>, and so on.&#160; However, the projection onto <span class="formula">h/j</span> is a proper group homomorphism.&#160; This is not surprising, since <span class="formula">k</span> is normal in <span class="formula">r</span>.&#160;
