<p>We already covered a great deal about groups in the chapter <a class="el" href="group__theory__cyclic.html">Theory: the structure of Abelian groups</a>.&nbsp; But well, those were Abelian.&nbsp; What about non-Abelian groups?</p>
<p>About the most general way to think about algebraic systems is by thinking about matrices.&nbsp; A set of <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrices filled with real numbers covers about anything except pure noise (at least, in my opinion).&nbsp; Yes, real numbers, because also the complex numbers can be covered with it.&nbsp; Lets do that as a first exercise.</p>
<p>Consider the set of matrices,</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ F = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a \\ \end{pmatrix} \,\vert\, a \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \]" src="form_1022_211.png"/>
</p>
<p>then this set is obviously isomorphic with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{R}$" src="form_1022_212.png"/> ( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$F \cong \mathbb{R}$" src="form_1022_213.png"/>) and therefore it is a field itself.&nbsp; I will assume you are familiar with the rules of multiplying matrices, so check for yourself that this set of <span class="formula">2 <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/> 2</span> matrices behaves exactly like ordinary real numbers.&nbsp; Please note that the multiplicative identity is the matrix where <span class="formula">a = 1</span>, and the additive identity is the matrix where <span class="formula">a = 0</span>.&nbsp; We will use that without further notice below, so don't get confused.</p>
<p>Next, lets extend the field <span class="formula">F</span> by adjoining a <span class="formula">t</span> to it:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ K = F(t) \]" src="form_1022_214.png"/>
</p>
<p>Hey, I can't help it, that is the way to write that you extend a field with some new element and all elements that naturally follow from it in order to make the field closed again.&nbsp; Note that adjoining an element to a <em>ring</em> is written <span class="formula">R[t]</span>, using <em>square brackets</em>. We can also speak about the field extension <span class="formula">K : F</span>, and write the extension degree as <span class="formula">m = [K : F]</span>.&nbsp; Its just a new notation that I thought I'd throw in, we did this <a class="el" href="group__theory__polynomial.html">before</a>.</p>
<p>However, in this case we don't specify a reduction polynomial for <span class="formula">t</span> but instead we specify exactly what it is:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1022_215.png"/>
</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that there isn't a reduction polynomial however.&nbsp; It is easy to verify that</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t^2 + \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1022_216.png"/>
</p>
<p>so the left hand side of that equation is the reduction polynomial (it is irreducible).&nbsp; As you will have noticed, the square of <span class="formula">t</span> is equal to the additive inverse of the multiplicative identity:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ t^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \]" src="form_1022_217.png"/>
</p>
<p>And therefore we can identify <span class="formula">t</span> with the complex number <span class="formula">i</span> and establish that <span class="formula">K = F(t)</span> is isomorphic with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{C}$" src="form_1022_218.png"/>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ok, back to arbitrary <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrices.&nbsp; When the matrix isn't square (<span class="formula">n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1022_12.png"/> m</span>) then you can't multiply them.&nbsp; You can still add them, but that isn't very interesting - that would be something isomorphic with a <span class="formula">nm</span> dimensional vectorspace and that is not what we want to investigate (we are not investigating matrices, we just use them as example), so forget about adding for now.&nbsp; Of course you'd still be able to multiply a <span class="formula">NxM</span> matrix with a <span class="formula">MxN</span> matrix, but putting matrices of different shape into a set will never form a group because in a group (where the binary operator is multiplication) you need to be able to multiply any two elements.&nbsp; In other words, we are only interested in <em>square</em> <span class="formula">NxN</span> matrices.</p>
<p>Actually, we are only interested in <em>finite</em> groups (so I guess the title of this chapter is a bit misleading).&nbsp; That means we can also put a restrictions on the elements of the matrices: the elements of the matrices are finite (unit) rings (like <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}_n$" src="form_1022_219.png"/> for some <span class="formula">n &gt; 0</span> in <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{N}$" src="form_1022_13.png"/>).&nbsp; A ring is set of elements for which addition, subtraction (additive inverse) exists and multiplication is defined and algebraically closed (the result of such an operation stays inside the ring) but not division because not all elements necessarily have a multiplicative inverse.&nbsp; A <em>unit</em> ring is a ring with a multiplicative identity in it (1) and I like that because I insist to be able to construct identity matrix for our group that looks a bit familiar.</p>
<p>Another axiom of groups is that there must exist an inverse for every element.&nbsp; Therefore we need to restrict ourself to matrices that have inverses.&nbsp; Note that this means that a matrix with all zeroes is not an element of our group!&nbsp; That's ok, we don't need it: we don't have an addition operator, so we don't need the additive identity (which is what zero is).</p>
<p>Karl Dahlke owns a wonderful <a href="http://www.mathreference.com">site</a>, a must for your bookmarks, with a large collection of lectures on many mathematical topics.&nbsp; Below you will find a copy of his chapters on <a href="http://www.mathreference.com/grp,intro.html">Group Theory</a>, reproduced almost literally here with his permission.&nbsp; Then each paragraph is followed by a block of text from my hand, clearly marked with a different background color.&nbsp; My main goal with those extra sections is to provide (additional) examples, and sometimes clarifications.</p>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> Let <span class="formula">S</span> be the finite set of <span class="formula">NxN</span> matrices, with elements from a given finite ring, all of which matrices have an inverse.&nbsp; Let <span class="formula">x</span> be one of those matrices.&nbsp; Then <span class="formula">x<sup>n</sup></span> eventually repeats an earlier value, say <span class="formula">x<sup>m</sup></span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">m</span> were <span class="formula">2</span>, or anything larger, we would cancel an <span class="formula">x</span> from each side, so assume <span class="formula">m = 1</span>.&nbsp; Thus <span class="formula">x<sup>n</sup> = x</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">e</span> (the identity) <span class="formula">= x<sup>n-1</sup></span>.&nbsp; For any <span class="formula">y, yx = yx<sup>n</sup> = yex</span>, and by cancellation (<span class="formula">x</span> must have an inverse), <span class="formula">yxx<sup>-1</sup> = y = yexx<sup>-1</sup> = ye</span>.&nbsp; Do the same on the left to show <span class="formula">y = ey</span>, hence e is an identity element.&nbsp; There can only be one such element <span class="formula">e</span>, for if there were two, <span class="formula">ef = e</span> and <span class="formula">ef = f</span>, whence <span class="formula">e = f</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that every <span class="formula">x</span> in <span class="formula">S</span> leads to <span class="formula">e</span> eventually.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">x<sup>n-1</sup> = e</span>, then <span class="formula">x<sup>n-2</sup></span> is the inverse of <span class="formula">x</span>.&nbsp; This breaks down if <span class="formula">n = 2</span>, but in that case <span class="formula">xx = x</span>, and <span class="formula">x</span> is in fact the identity element.&nbsp; So we have found an identity and inverses, and the set becomes a group.</p>

<p class="formulaDsp">

</p>
<p>And when now you expect the two new points to have order 6, then you lose.&nbsp; Both new points are mysteriously an involution as well.&nbsp; In fact, the largest cyclic subgroups they are a part of have order 2, so they are indistinguisable from the generator of <span class="formula">H<sub>1</sub></span>.&nbsp; Note that there are really not more elements in this group; if you multiply any two elements <span class="formula">a, b <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> H<sub>6</sub></span> either as <span class="formula">ab</span> or as <span class="formula">ba</span> then the result is again in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Please be warned, these groups are by far not large enough to get an insight in the structure of non-Abelian groups, but it suffices to get an understanding of the concept <em>subgroup</em>.</p>
<p>Our example group <span class="formula">G</span> has 54 different subgroups.&nbsp; We already mentioned the 28 cyclic subgroups above of rank 1.&nbsp; Furthermore it has 26 subgroups of rank 2 (which means that there are a minimum of two generators needed to generate all elements).&nbsp; <span class="formula">G</span> itself also has a rank of 2.&nbsp; Then there is one subgroup of rank 2 with 24 elements, 3 subgroups of rank 2 with 16 elements, 4 subgroups of rank 2 with 12 elements each, 4 subgroups of rank 2 (and 3 of rank 1) with 8 elements, 8 subgroups of rank 2 (and 4 of rank 1) with 6 elements and 6 subgroups of rank 2 (and 3 with rank 1) with 4 elements.&nbsp; The program that was used to brute force check this can be found in <code>testsuite/point/groups.cc</code>.</p>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> If you haven't seen cosets before, group theory can be a difficult place to start.&nbsp; (It's so abstract).&nbsp; Let me explain the idea of a coset in more general terms.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">h</span> be a substructure inside <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; Shifted copies of <span class="formula">h</span> are called cosets of <span class="formula">h</span>, and they cover all of <span class="formula">g</span> without overlap.&nbsp; For example, let <span class="formula">g</span> be the xy plane and let <span class="formula">h</span> be the x axis.&nbsp; For every real number <span class="formula">c</span>, the line running parallel to the x axis, through <span class="formula">y = c</span>, is a coset of the x axis.&nbsp; These cosets cover the entire plane without overlap.</p>
<p>The quotient <span class="formula">g/h</span> is the collection of cosets.&nbsp; In this example, the quotient is really (isomorphic with) the y axis.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let's build cosets of the subgroup <span class="formula">h</span> inside the group <span class="formula">g</span>.</p>
<p>Given a subgroup <span class="formula">h</span>, the right coset of an element <span class="formula">x</span> is the set of elements <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\cdot$" src="form_1022_49.png"/>x</span>.&nbsp; Left cosets are defined similarly, i.e. <span class="formula">x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\cdot$" src="form_1022_49.png"/>h</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> are in <span class="formula">h</span>, and <span class="formula">ax = bx</span>, then cancel <span class="formula">x</span>, and <span class="formula">a = b</span>.&nbsp; All the elements in a coset are distinct.&nbsp; there are <span class="formula">|h|</span> of them.</p>
<p>In fact the elements of any given coset, left or right, correspond one-on-one with the elements of <span class="formula">h</span>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the identity in <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">x</span> is always in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (reflexivity).&nbsp; Since we can always multiply by the inverse of an element in <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">x</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> iff <span class="formula">y</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (symmetry).&nbsp; If <span class="formula">z</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">z</span> is in the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> (transitivity).&nbsp; In other words, <span class="formula">y = ax</span> and <span class="formula">z = by</span>, hence <span class="formula">z = bax</span>.&nbsp; We have an equivalence relation, and <span class="formula">g</span> can be partitioned into well defined cosets.&nbsp; These cosets have the same size, or cardinality, namely <span class="formula">|h|</span>.</p>
 
</DIV>
<DIV class="me">
 The above means that if you have some <span class="formula">a</span> that is an element of the subgroup <span class="formula">h</span> of <span class="formula">g</span>, then multiplying <span class="formula">a</span> with any element <span class="formula">x</span> of <span class="formula">g</span> causes the result to be part of a coset of <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; When <span class="formula">x</span> is also in <span class="formula">h</span>, then the result is also again in <span class="formula">h</span> of course, and the coset is really just <span class="formula">h</span> itself.&nbsp; It gets more interestingly when you multiply with some <span class="formula">x</span> that is not in <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; The result will be that you get a complete copy of <span class="formula">h</span>, of the same size, none of whose elements are in <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; Moreover, you could have multiplied with <em>any</em> element of this coset and you'd have gotten the same coset: each element of the coset is thus a representative for that coset.&nbsp; It follows also trivially that there are in total <span class="formula">|g| / |h|</span> cosets of <span class="formula">h</span>.</p>
<p>For example, let us multiply each element of <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span> with some <span class="formula">x</span> not in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>.&nbsp; Without changing the order in the coset, this will be the element that becomes below the identity then (reflexivity).</p>

</p>
<p>where the <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$" src="form_1022_227.png"/> was chosen arbitrarily, just something not in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>.</p>
<p>This was a right coset.&nbsp; A left coset would have looked like this:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \cdot H_6 = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 2 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 2 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 2 \\ 2 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \]" src="form_1022_237.png"/>
</p>
<p>Note that this <em>does</em> overlap (the first element) with the right coset.</p>
<p>If we had picked any other element of the right-coset <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span> that we found, it would have generated the same coset.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ H_6 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 2 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \]" src="form_1022_238.png"/>
</p>
<p>which is indeed the same coset as <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span>.</p>
<p>By picking yet another element of <span class="formula">G</span>, that is not in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span> nor in <span class="formula"><em>coset<sub>1</sub></em></span>, we can generate another right coset with 6 new elements, etcetera.&nbsp; Since there are 48 elements in <span class="formula">G</span> and 6 elements in <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>, we will be able to generate in total 8 distinct right-cosets from <span class="formula">H<sub>6</sub></span>, each with 6 different elements, until all of <span class="formula">G</span> is covered.</p>
<p>Finally note that these cosets are <em>not</em> groups, they don't even contain the identity element.&nbsp; However, cosets can act as group elements themselfs.&nbsp; Consider a set <span class="formula">S</span> of <em>cosets</em> of a subgroup <span class="formula">H</span> of a group <span class="formula">G</span>.&nbsp; Then we know that each coset has the same number of elements and that any element of <span class="formula">G</span> occurs only in one of the cosets.&nbsp; We can write a coset of <span class="formula">H</span> represented by some <span class="formula">x</span> in <span class="formula">G</span> as:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ \left\{ xh \,\vert\, h \in H \right\} \]" src="form_1022_239.png"/>
</p>
<p>or in short</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ xH \]" src="form_1022_240.png"/>
</p>
<p>As said before, any <span class="formula">x</span> element of this particular coset will lead to the same coset.</p>
<p>We can write the set of all cosets of <span class="formula">H</span> as:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ \left\{ xH \,\vert\, x \in G \right\} \]" src="form_1022_241.png"/>
</p>
<p>Now let <img class="formulaInl" alt="$A,B \in \left\{ xH \,\vert\, x \in G \right\}$" src="form_1022_242.png"/>.&nbsp; In other words, <span class="formula">A</span> and <span class="formula">B</span> are cosets of <span class="formula">H</span>.</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ A = \left\{ ah \,\vert\, h \in H \right\} = aH \]" src="form_1022_243.png"/>

<p class="formulaDsp">
<img class="formulaDsp" alt="\[ B = \left\{ bh \,\vert\, h \in H \right\} = bH \]" src="form_1022_244.png"/>
</p>
<p>for some <img class="formulaInl" alt="$a,b \in G$" src="form_1022_245.png"/>.&nbsp; Then <span class="formula">AB</span> is defined as</p>

<p>As you can see, <span class="formula">N</span> acts as the identity element here.&nbsp; Let me make clear how this works by working out the details again like I did in the paragraph about cosets above.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> O</span> be a cosrep of <span class="formula">O</span> so that <span class="formula">O = o<sub>1</sub>N</span>.&nbsp; Furthermore note that we can take any <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> N</span> be the cosrep of <span class="formula">N</span>, so also the identity matrix <span class="formula">e</span>: <span class="formula">N = eN</span>.&nbsp; Then, for any coset <span class="formula">A = aN</span> of <span class="formula">N</span> we have that <span class="formula">AN = aeN = aN = A</span>.&nbsp; And likewise <span class="formula">NA = eaN = aN = A.</span>&nbsp; It isn't needed that <span class="formula">N</span> is a <em>normal</em> subgroup for <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>The only interesting case is therefore <span class="formula">O<sup>2</sup></span>.</p>

</p>
<p>Because <span class="formula">N</span> is normal, the left and right cosets coincide and there will exist some <span class="formula">o<sub>3</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> O</span> such that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub> = h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>3</sub></span>.&nbsp; Realize that in general <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1022_12.png"/> h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>1</sub></span>!&nbsp; And because <span class="formula">h<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub></span> is again an element of <span class="formula">N</span>, lets say <span class="formula">h</span>, there will also exist some <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> O</span> such that <span class="formula">h<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub>o<sub>3</sub> = ho<sub>3</sub> = o<sub>2</sub>h</span> and we see that</p>

<p>Now whatever coset of <span class="formula">N</span> this is, it is fixed of course, independent of the choice of <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span>.&nbsp; It is easy to see that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub></span> cannot be an element of <span class="formula">O</span>.&nbsp; Because, suppose that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> = o <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> O</span>, then there must exist a <span class="formula">h <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> N</span> such that <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>h = o</span> from which follows that <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span> would be in <span class="formula">N</span> and it isn't.&nbsp; Therefore <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\notin$" src="form_1022_254.png"/> O</span>.&nbsp; Now, in our case, the only thing outside <span class="formula">O</span> is <span class="formula">N</span>, hence <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub>o<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> N</span> for any two matrices <span class="formula">o<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">o<sub>2</sub></span> in <span class="formula">O</span> and thus <img class="formulaInl" alt="$O \cdot O = N$" src="form_1022_255.png"/>.</p>

<p>The identity represents the identity coset, and a coset's inverse is found by inverting one of its cosreps.&nbsp; The resulting group of cosets is called the quotient group, or the factor group, and <span class="formula">h</span> is called the kernel.&nbsp; In fact, we will now switch notation, whence <span class="formula">k</span> is the kernel and <span class="formula">h</span> is the quotient group.&nbsp; Hope this isn't too confusing.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the quotient retains the coarse structure of the group, without all the fine detail; like looking at an object through the wrong end of a telescope.&nbsp; <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>15</sub></span> has a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">{0, 5, 10}</span>, and a quotient group with cosreps 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, i.e. <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>5</sub></span>.&nbsp; The quotient tells us that the original group has some similarity to the integers mod 5; the kernel tells us the group has something to do with <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>3</sub></span>.&nbsp; Of course we could have used <span class="formula">{0, 3, 6, 9, 12}</span> as kernel, making <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>3</sub></span> the quotient.&nbsp; We don't always have the option to switch kernel and quotient, but in this case we do.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">g</span> consists of the powers of a generator <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">g</span> is cyclic.&nbsp; The only cyclic groups are the integers and the integers mod n, for all positive values of n.&nbsp; The finite cyclic groups are denoted <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>n</sub></span>.&nbsp; These groups are simple iff <span class="formula">n</span> is prime.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">n = pq</span>, <span class="formula">g</span> can have the factor group <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span> or <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>q</sub></span>, as demonstrated by <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>15</sub></span> above.</p>
 </DIV><DIV class="me"><p>The above repeats more or less what I've already said before, except that it introduces two new names: the normal subgroup is called <em>kernel</em> (from now on denoted with <span class="formula">K</span>) and the set of cosets of this kernel, which form a group by themselfs thus, is called <em>quotient</em>.&nbsp; This quotient is also be denoted with <span class="formula">G/K</span> in literature.&nbsp; That notation is slightly counter intuitive as it gives one the feeling that the result is something smaller than <span class="formula">G</span>, and one wouldn't expect <span class="formula">K</span> itself to be an element of this quotient either.&nbsp; But in fact, the quotient group <span class="formula">G/K</span> is just the set of all cosets of <span class="formula">K</span> within <span class="formula">G</span>, including the identity coset <span class="formula">K</span> itself.&nbsp; And all cosets together still cover all of <span class="formula">G</span>.&nbsp; The number of elements in <span class="formula">G/K</span> however is exactly equal to <span class="formula">|G/K| = |G|/|K|</span>, which makes the use of the slash a bit more logical.</p>

<p>Please note that while we use multiplication for the matrices, and for the general theory in Karls lectures, the group operator of the integers <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> is <em>addition</em>!&nbsp; The cosets in <span class="formula">{x + n <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> | x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/>}</span> have a natural set of cosreps, namely those values of <span class="formula">x</span> for which <span class="formula">0 <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\leq$" src="form_1022_18.png"/> x &lt; n</span>.&nbsp; Moreover, those cosets form a group that is <em>isomorphic</em> with <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>n</sub></span>.&nbsp; They're thus not the <em>exact</em> same thing.</p>
<p>There is another nice example that gives insight.&nbsp; Again this example is Abelian, unfortunately, but still worth remembering.&nbsp; Consider vectors in a 2D plane through the origin.&nbsp; They form a group under the operation of <em>addition</em>.&nbsp; The origin is the identity element, inverses are vectors with the same length but pointing in opposite direction and adding any two vectors in the plane will result again in a vector in that same plane, etc.&nbsp; Now, in 3D space, take a vector <span class="formula">x</span> that is not an element of this plane, but instead an element of the rest of the 3D space (this 3D space is our <span class="formula">G</span>, which obviously also a group).&nbsp; The plane through the origin (<span class="formula">K</span>) is thus a (normal) subgroup of the 3D space (it is trivially normal because this is Abelian).&nbsp; Adding the vector <span class="formula">x</span> to the plane results in a plane <em>not</em> going through the origin, but parallel to the orignal plane.&nbsp; This new plane, <span class="formula">x + K</span>, is a coset of the original plane <span class="formula">K</span>.&nbsp; The complete set of cosets of <span class="formula">K</span>, <span class="formula">G/K</span>, fills all of the 3D space, all of <span class="formula">G</span>.&nbsp; All those planes together form a group that are isomorphic with a group of just a set of cosreps of those planes, for example, a line perpendicular to the planes (although any straight line would do).&nbsp; This line is indeed again a group, as <span class="formula">G/K</span> should be.&nbsp; Moreover, in this case we can, as was explained in the example of Karl too, exchange the kernel and the quotient: we can take any line as kernel (because, since this is Abelian, also the line is a normal subgroup) and observe that the quotient with this line is isomorphic with a plane through the origin.</p>

</td><td align=right><font size="-2">Copyright &copy; 2002-2004 Karl Dahlke</font></td></tr></table> Taken from an old Greek word for shape, the various "morphisms" preserve the structure of a group, or at least part of its structure.&nbsp; Actually these terms are applied to many different objects, not just groups.&nbsp; If an object is based on a set, with one or more operators that define that object, and a function <span class="formula">f</span> maps this set to another set, and <span class="formula">f</span> preserves the defining operators, then <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism.&nbsp; Rings and fields have two operators that must commute with <span class="formula">f</span>; groups have only one.&nbsp; Let's look at a simple example.</p>
<p>Let <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> be the group of integers under addition and let <span class="formula">f</span> map <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> onto <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> mod 7.&nbsp; Note that we can take <span class="formula">x+y mod 7</span>, and that's the same as taking <span class="formula">x mod 7</span> and adding it to <span class="formula">y mod 7</span> (and then again doing the result mod 7).&nbsp; In other words, <span class="formula">f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)</span>.&nbsp; That's it; that's all we need for a group homomorphism.</p>
<p>Every normal subgroup defines a group homomorphism.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">k</span> is a normal subgroup, and <span class="formula">h</span> the resulting quotient group, let the function <span class="formula">f</span> take an element <span class="formula">x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\in$" src="form_1022_4.png"/> g</span> to the coset of <span class="formula">k</span> represented by <span class="formula">x</span> ( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$f: x \mapsto xk$" src="form_1022_260.png"/>).&nbsp; As described in the previous section, <span class="formula">f</span> is a function from <span class="formula">g</span> onto <span class="formula">h</span>, where <span class="formula">g</span> and <span class="formula">h</span> are both groups; but is <span class="formula">f</span> a homomorphism?&nbsp; Does <span class="formula">f</span> commute with the multiplication operator?&nbsp; Well the coset of <span class="formula">x</span> times the coset of <span class="formula">y</span> is, by its very definition, the coset of <span class="formula">xy</span>.&nbsp; Thus <span class="formula">f</span> is a group homomorphism.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism from the group <span class="formula">g</span> onto the set <span class="formula">h</span>, which possesses a preexisting operator <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/>.&nbsp; Since <span class="formula">f</span> is a homomorphism, <span class="formula">f(x) <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/>f(y) = f(x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/>y)</span>.&nbsp; In other words, <span class="formula">f</span> commutes with <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/>.&nbsp; It is not hard to show that <span class="formula">h</span> is a group, inheriting all the group properties through <span class="formula">f</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">g</span> were a ring, <span class="formula">h</span> would be a ring, and so on.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">1</span> (the identity) in <span class="formula">g</span> map to an element we will call <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, and verify that <span class="formula">1</span> acts as an identity element in <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; That is, <span class="formula">f(1)f(x) = f(1x) = f(x)</span>, hence <span class="formula">1</span> leaves <span class="formula">h</span> where it is.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">k</span> be the set of elements in <span class="formula">g</span> that map to <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; For any <span class="formula">x</span> and <span class="formula">y</span> in <span class="formula">k</span>, <span class="formula">f(x) = f(y) = 1 in h</span>.&nbsp; Their product is <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, hence <span class="formula">f(xy) = 1</span>, hence <span class="formula">xy</span> is still in <span class="formula">k</span>.&nbsp; Inverses must also map to <span class="formula">1</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, and are present in <span class="formula">k</span>, hence <span class="formula">k</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>.</p>
<p>It is easy to show that <span class="formula">xk/x</span> remains in <span class="formula">k</span>, as <span class="formula">f(xk/x) = 1</span>, hence <span class="formula">k</span> is a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the elements of <span class="formula">h</span> correspond to the cosets of <span class="formula">k</span>, and are multiplied acccordingly.&nbsp; The image group <span class="formula">h</span> is indistinguishable from the quotient group <span class="formula">g/k</span>.&nbsp; A group homomorphism defines, and is defined by, a normal subgroup and quotient group.</p>
<p>If the kernel of a homomorphism is the identity element, <span class="formula">f</span> is a monomorphism.&nbsp; This comes from the Greek word mono, meaning one; the map is one-on-one.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">f</span> carries <span class="formula">g</span> onto the entire group <span class="formula">h</span>, rather than a piece of <span class="formula">h</span>, <span class="formula">f</span> is an epimorphism.&nbsp; This is usually what we mean when we say <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> to <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; Sometimes we say <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> "onto" <span class="formula">h</span> - same thing.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">f</span> maps <span class="formula">g</span> "into" <span class="formula">h</span>, it is not always an epimorphism.&nbsp; Take the integers mod 7, then multiply by 2.&nbsp; This maps <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/> onto the even numbers mod 14.&nbsp; It is a group homomorphism into <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>14</sub></span>, but it is not an epimorphism, because nothing maps to the odd numbers.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">f</span> is an epimorphism and a monomorphism it is an isomorphism.&nbsp; Elements map one-on-one, and all of <span class="formula">g</span> maps to all of <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; The map can be reversed to produce an inverse homomorphism.&nbsp; The two groups are indistinguishable.&nbsp; We have merely assigned different labels to the elements of <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; Some people would say these are in fact the same group; where the structure defines the group, without regard to the underlying set.&nbsp; This abstract definition is valid, because group isomorphism is an equivalence relation.&nbsp; We can clump all the isomorphic groups together and declare them a single group.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="formula">p</span> is prime there is only one group (structure) of order <span class="formula">p</span>, namely <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span>.&nbsp; Let <span class="formula">x</span> be an element, other than <span class="formula">1</span>, of some group <span class="formula">g</span> with <span class="formula">p</span> elements, and consider the powers of <span class="formula">x</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">x<sup>n</sup></span> becomes <span class="formula">1</span> before <span class="formula">n</span> reaches <span class="formula">p</span>, then <span class="formula">x</span> generates a proper subgroup, which is forbidden by <a class="el" href="group__theory__grouptheory.html#lagrange">Lagrange's theorem</a>.&nbsp; Hence <span class="formula">g</span> is merely the powers of <span class="formula">x</span>, and the exponents form the integers <span class="formula">mod p</span>.&nbsp; After some judicious relabeling, the group <em>is</em> <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span>.</p>

<p>If <span class="formula">x</span> produces an inner automorphism, and <span class="formula">f</span> is any other automorphism, having inverse <span class="formula">j</span>, apply <span class="formula">f</span>, then the <span class="formula">x</span> automorphism, then <span class="formula">j</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">w</span> is a group element, we have <span class="formula">j(x*f(w)/x)</span>.&nbsp; Since <span class="formula">j</span> commutes with <span class="formula">*</span>, this is <span class="formula">j(x)*j(f(w))/j(x)</span>, or <span class="formula">j(x)*w/j(x)</span>.&nbsp; The composition gives another inner automorphism, hence the subgroup of inner automorphisms is normal inside the (possibly larger) group of automorphisms.&nbsp; This implies a quotient group, the automorphisms mod the inner automorphisms.</p>
<p>The center of <span class="formula">g</span> are those elements that commute with all of g.&nbsp; They produce trivial inner automorphisms; if <span class="formula">x</span> commutes with everything then <span class="formula">xg/x</span> leaves <span class="formula">g</span> fixed.&nbsp; Conversely, if <span class="formula">x</span> is not in the center of <span class="formula">g</span> then <span class="formula">xy/x</span> is different from <span class="formula">y</span> for some <span class="formula">y</span>, and the resulting inner automorphism is nontrivial.</p>
<p>Map <span class="formula">g</span> onto the inner automorphisms of <span class="formula">g</span> by carrying <span class="formula">x</span> to the function <span class="formula">xg/x</span>.&nbsp; We must show that this is a homomorphism.&nbsp; Compose <span class="formula">xg/x</span> with <span class="formula">yg/y</span> and get <span class="formula">yxg/x/y</span>, the inner automorphism associated with <span class="formula">yx</span>.&nbsp; Technically, we were hoping for the inner automorphism associated with <span class="formula">xy</span>.&nbsp; This is not a show stopper though.&nbsp; Change the convention, so that the composition of two automorphisms is the second, followed by the first, rather than the first followed by the second.&nbsp; The automorphisms of <span class="formula">g</span> still form a group.&nbsp; Now the composition of <span class="formula">xg/x</span> and <span class="formula">yg/y</span> is <span class="formula">xyg/y/x</span>, as it should be, and the map from <span class="formula">g</span> onto its inner automorphisms is indeed a group homomorphism.</p>
<p>We showed that the kernel of this map is precisely the center of <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; Thus the inner automorphisms of <span class="formula">g</span>, with function composition defined as above, form a group that is isomorphic to <span class="formula">g</span> mod its center.</p>

<p>We've already seen examples of this.&nbsp; The group <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>7</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>7</sub></span> contains 49 elements, two parallel copies of the integers mod 7.&nbsp; For instance: <span class="formula">2,5 + 3,4 = 5,2</span>.</p>
<p>Project <span class="formula">j</span> onto <span class="formula">g</span> or <span class="formula">h</span> by throwing away the "other" component.&nbsp; This is a group homomorphism, hence either <span class="formula">g</span> or <span class="formula">h</span> can act as the kernel of <span class="formula">j</span>, with <span class="formula">h</span> or <span class="formula">g</span> playing the role of factor group.</p>
<p>Apply the above several times to take the direct product of a finite number of groups.</p>
<p>The direct product of an infinite set of groups is also well defined.&nbsp; We don't have to worry about the axiom of choice, because every set has a special element, the group identity.&nbsp; The direct product includes the element <span class="formula">1,1,1,1,1,1...</span> which acts as the identity element for the composite group.&nbsp; Group operations are performed per component.</p>
<p>The direct sum is essentially defined in the same way as the direct product: group operations are still performed per component, but almost all components are set to the identity element.&nbsp; See more on the direct sum <a href="http://www.mathreference.com/set,dirsum.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the direct product or sum of <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1022_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span> for all primes <span class="formula">p</span>.&nbsp; The prime cycles run in parallel, and independent of each other.&nbsp; The element <span class="formula">0,0,0,0...</span> is the group identity.&nbsp; In the direct product, the element <span class="formula">1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...</span> is well defined.&nbsp; In the direct sum, almost all components must be <span class="formula">0</span>, as in <span class="formula">1,2,3,0,5,0,0,0,0...</span> zeros thereafter.</p>

<p>Use the "group action" convention, where the automorphism defined by <span class="formula">xy</span> is the automorphism of <span class="formula">y</span>, followed by the automorphism of <span class="formula">x</span>.&nbsp; This seems backwards, but it's actually more convenient.&nbsp; Naturally, <span class="formula">f<sub>1</sub> = 1</span>, the trivial automorphism, and the automorphism <span class="formula">f<sub>1/x</sub></span> is the inverse automorphism of <span class="formula">f<sub>x</sub></span>.</p>
<p>If automorphisms have been assigned to the generators of <span class="formula">h</span>, then we have the entire map from <span class="formula">h</span> into the automorphisms of <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">h</span> is cyclic, for instance, generated by <span class="formula">x</span>, we only need know <span class="formula">f<sub>x</sub></span>.&nbsp; Then <span class="formula">f<sub>x*x</sub></span> is <span class="formula">f<sub>x</sub></span> applied twice, and so on.</p>

<p>Does <span class="formula">g<sub>1</sub>,h<sub>1</sub></span> have an inverse?&nbsp; Let <span class="formula">f</span> be the automorphism associated with <span class="formula">h<sub>1</sub></span>.&nbsp; Apply <span class="formula">f</span> inverse to the inverse of <span class="formula">g<sub>1</sub></span> and call this <span class="formula">g<sub>2</sub></span>.&nbsp; Sure enough, <span class="formula">g<sub>1</sub>f(g<sub>2</sub>)</span> produces the identity in <span class="formula">g</span>, hence <span class="formula">g<sub>2</sub>,h<sub>2</sub></span> is the inverse of <span class="formula">g<sub>1</sub>,h<sub>1</sub></span>, and <span class="formula">j</span> is a group.</p>
<p>A simple homomorphism maps <span class="formula">j</span> onto <span class="formula">h</span>, with <span class="formula">g</span> as kernel.&nbsp; Thus <span class="formula">j</span> is the "semidirect product of <span class="formula">g</span> by <span class="formula">h</span>".</p>

<p>If two triples lead to the same element, i.e. <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>1</sub>j<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>2</sub>j<sub>2</sub></span>, multiply by <span class="formula">x<sub>2</sub></span> inverse on the left.&nbsp; Now the product <span class="formula">x<sub>2</sub></span> inverse times <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub></span>, call it <span class="formula">x<sub>3</sub></span>, is multiplied by something in <span class="formula">k</span>, and produces something in <span class="formula">k</span>.&nbsp; Clearly <span class="formula">x<sub>3</sub></span> is in <span class="formula">k</span>, and in <span class="formula">h</span>, hence in <span class="formula">j</span>, so the original cosreps <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">x<sub>2</sub></span> are the same.&nbsp; Divide these out, leaving elements in <span class="formula">k</span>.</p>
<p>Now <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub> = y<sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="formula">j<sub>1</sub> = j<sub>2</sub></span>, and the triples were in fact the same.&nbsp; Elements of <span class="formula">r</span> correspond one on one with triples drawn from <span class="formula">x</span>, <span class="formula">y</span>, and <span class="formula">j</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">r</span> is finite, the order of <span class="formula">r</span> is <span class="formula">|h|*|k|/|j|</span>.</p>
<p>Don't assume you can just multiply components together.&nbsp; After all, <span class="formula">r</span> is not a direct product.&nbsp; When we pull elements past each other, <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub></span> is replaced with <span class="formula">y<sub>3</sub></span>, and so on.&nbsp; However, the projection onto <span class="formula">h/j</span> is a proper group homomorphism.&nbsp; This is not surprising, since <span class="formula">k</span> is normal in <span class="formula">r</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">e<sub>1</sub></span> begins with <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub></span>, and <span class="formula">e<sub>2</sub></span> starts with <span class="formula">x<sub>2</sub></span>, then <span class="formula">e<sub>1</sub>e<sub>2</sub></span> starts with <span class="formula">x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></span>.&nbsp; The cosets of <span class="formula">j</span> in <span class="formula">h</span> faithfully represent the cosets of <span class="formula">k</span> in <span class="formula">r</span>.</p>

<p>This theorem, or theorems if you prefer, asserts the equivalence of the subgroups or normal subgroups of <span class="formula">g</span> with those in the factor group <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; In other words, subgroups containing <span class="formula">k</span>, or normal subgroups containing <span class="formula">k</span>, correspond one on one with subgroups or normal subgroups in the factor group <span class="formula">g/k</span>.&nbsp; Let's get started.</p>
<p>Let <span class="formula">k</span> be a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>, with factor group <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; If <span class="formula">r</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>, its image <span class="formula">s</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; Conversely, if <span class="formula">s</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">h</span>, its preimage <span class="formula">r</span> is a subgroup of <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; Use the <span class="formula"><a href="#ab">a/b</a></span> criterion to verify this.</p>
<p>Applying the <span class="formula"><a href="#xhx">x*w/x</a></span> criterion, verify <span class="formula">r</span> is normal in <span class="formula">g</span> iff its image is normal in <span class="formula">h</span>, and <span class="formula">s</span> is normal in <span class="formula">h</span> iff its preimage is normal in <span class="formula">g</span>.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="formula">h</span> is normal in <span class="formula">g</span>, and <span class="formula">k</span> is normal in both <span class="formula">h</span> and <span class="formula">g</span>.&nbsp; Let <span class="formula">q</span> be the factor group <span class="formula">g/k</span>.&nbsp; By the above, the image of <span class="formula">h</span> in <span class="formula">q</span> is a normal subgroup of <span class="formula">q</span>.&nbsp; This leads to a factor group <span class="formula">r</span>.&nbsp; We will show that <span class="formula">r</span> is the same as <span class="formula">g/h</span>.</p>
<p>The map is straightforward, though somewhat technical.&nbsp; Given a coset of <span class="formula">h</span> in <span class="formula">g</span>, choose a cosrep <span class="formula">x</span>, let it define a coset of <span class="formula">k</span> in <span class="formula">g</span>, i.e. an element of <span class="formula">q</span>, and let that element of <span class="formula">q</span> define a coset of the image of <span class="formula">h</span> in <span class="formula">q</span>, i.e. an element of <span class="formula">r</span>.&nbsp; We need to show this is well defined.&nbsp; Multiply <span class="formula">x</span> by <span class="formula">y</span> for some <span class="formula">y</span> in <span class="formula">h</span>, and see if this changes anything.&nbsp; Moving to <span class="formula">q</span>, the image of <span class="formula">x</span> is multiplied by something in the image of <span class="formula">h</span>.&nbsp; This leads to the same element of <span class="formula">r</span>.&nbsp; So it doesn't matter which cosrep we use.</p>
<p>Use the property of group homomorphism, from <span class="formula">g</span> to <span class="formula">q</span> to <span class="formula">r</span>, to show this map commutes with <span class="formula">*</span>, and is a group homomorphism.&nbsp; Since <span class="formula">q</span> is the image of <span class="formula">g</span> and <span class="formula">r</span> is the image of <span class="formula">q</span>, the map is onto.&nbsp; Finally, different cosets of <span class="formula">h</span> in <span class="formula">g</span> lead to different cosets of the image of <span class="formula">h</span> in <span class="formula">q</span>, hence the map is an isomorphism.</p>

<p>The dihedral group <span class="formula">D<sub>n</sub></span> is the rotations and reflections of a regular n-gon.&nbsp; Picture an n-gon with thickness, similar to a coin with edges.&nbsp; In fact dihedral comes from the latin, meaning two surfaces, like heads and tails.&nbsp; Assign numbers to the edges of the coin, so you know what is going on.&nbsp; Place the coin on the table with edge #1 facing front.&nbsp; Rotate the coin one notch clockwise, then turn it over.&nbsp; Edge #1 has been shifted to the left, then flipped over to the right.&nbsp; Edge #2 is directly in front of you.&nbsp; Now reverse the operations; flip the coin and then turn it clockwise.&nbsp; Edge #1 still faces front after the flip, then shifts left.&nbsp; This is not where it was before, hence the group is nonabelian.</p>
<p>The subgroup of pure rotations is <span class="formula">Z<sub>n</sub></span>, and it has index <span class="formula">2</span>, hence it is normal in the dihedral group.&nbsp; All other group elements are involutions, except for the identity element (leave the coin alone).</p>
<p>For <span class="formula">n = 1</span>, the dihedral group is <span class="formula">Z<sub>2</sub></span>, like a stick standing up, flipping end over end.</p>
<p>For <span class="formula">n = 2</span>, the coin has two edges, a fron edge and a back edge, and some thickness, so we can flip it over.&nbsp; The group consists of vertical flips cross horizontal flips.&nbsp; These are independent of each other, hence the group is <span class="formula">Z<sub>2</sub> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\times$" src="form_1022_59.png"/>Z<sub>2</sub></span>.&nbsp; This is not a cyclic group, not the same as <span class="formula">Z<sub>4</sub></span>, but it is abelian.</p>
<p>When the coin has <span class="formula">3</span> or more edges, it looks like a traditional n-gon, and the group is non-abelian.</p>

<p>Given a permutation, count how many times a larger number precedes a smaller number in the list.&nbsp; If this count is even the permutation is even, else it is odd.&nbsp; The identity permutation, <span class="formula">12345</span>, has zero pairs out of order, hence it is even.&nbsp; The permutation <span class="formula">54321</span> has ten pairs out of order, and is also even.</p>
<p>If two adjacent elements are swapped, i.e. a transposition, the parity of the permutation is reversed.&nbsp; The swap only changes the pair in question; all other pairs are unaffected.&nbsp; The swapped elements are moved into or out of ascending order, hence the parity is flipped.</p>
<p>Every permutation can be implemented by a series of transpositions.&nbsp; There may be many ways to do this, but an even permutation is always achieved using an even number of transpositions, and an odd permutation requires an odd number of transpositions.</p>
<p>The composition of even permutations is even.&nbsp; The first is achieved using an even number of transpositions, and so is the second, hence the composition is built using an even number of transpositions, and is even.&nbsp; In general, even and odd permutations add together just like even and odd numbers.&nbsp; Parity is a group homomorphism from the permutation group <span class="formula">g</span> into <span class="formula">Z<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="formula">g</span> includes odd permutations, the even permutations form a proper subgroup that maps to <span class="formula">0</span> under parity, while the odd permutations map to <span class="formula">1</span>.&nbsp; The even permutations form the kernel of the parity homomorphism, and are a normal subgroup in <span class="formula">g</span>.</p>
