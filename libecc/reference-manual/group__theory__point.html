<h3>Galois field</h3>
In this chapter it is assumed that you've read and understood the <a class="el" href="group__theory__polynomial.html">theory </a> of the Galois field <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$" src="form_1036_5.png"/></span> (in literature also often denoted with <span class="formula">GF(2<sup>m</sup>)</span>).&#160; In particular the fact that such a field has a finite number of elements (namely <span class="formula">2<sup>m</sup></span>, also called the size, order or <em><a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Cardinality.html">cardinality</a></em> of the field) and that the properties of the field are solely determined by this cardinality: any two fields with the same number of elements are isomorphic (that means that there is a one-on-one relationship between all the elements of the two fields (called a <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Bijection.html">bijective</a> map) that retains the additive and multiplicative relationships).&#160; Most notably, every element <span class="formula">E</span> of the field has one and only one <a class="el" href="classlibecc_1_1polynomial.html#acdedde5dbebd17a51da066736a7e0803">solution </a> <span class="formula">S</span> to the equation <span class="formula">S<sup>2</sup> = E</span>.&#160; This is a result of having characteristic 2; normally one would expect to have two solutions: <span class="formula">+ <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\sqrt{E}$" src="form_1036_264.png" width="20" height="14"/></span> and <span class="formula">- <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\sqrt{E}$" src="form_1036_264.png" width="20" height="14"/></span>, but since <span class="formula">-1 <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\equiv$" src="form_1036_14.png"/> +1</span> those are the same and we only have one solution.<a class="anchor" id="characteristic"></a>The cardinality of the Galois field <span class="formula">2<sup>m</sup></span> (the number of elements in it), is not to be confused with what is known as the field <em>characteristic</em>.&#160; The field <em>characteristic</em> is 2, in this case.&#160; The meaning of the <em>characteristic</em> of finite fields, usually denoted with <span class="formula">p</span>, is that it is the smallest positive integer for which <span class="formula">pE = 0</span> for every element <span class="formula">E</span> of the field.&#160; This <em>characteristic</em> is noted down with <span class="formula">p</span> because it is always prime for finite fields (Note that in the case of fields with a ground field (also called base field, or prime field; in our case it is <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>2</sub></span>, in the more general case it is either <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Z}$" src="form_1036_58.png"/><sub>p</sub></span> or <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Q}$" src="form_1036_265.png" width="11" height="13"/>) of infinite cardinality (thus with ground field <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{Q}$" src="form_1036_265.png" width="11" height="13"/>) the characteristic is said to be <span class="formula">0</span>, not infinite).&#160; It is easy to derive this: Let <span class="formula">K</span> be a field with <em>characteristic</em> <span class="formula">p</span>.&#160; Then if it were possible to write <span class="formula">p = qr</span> with q and r integers larger than 1, then there has to exist an element <span class="formula">A</span> for which <span class="formula">B = qA <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> 0</span> (otherwise q would be the <em>characteristic</em>) and an element <span class="formula">C</span> for which <span class="formula">D = rC <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> 0</span>.&#160; Furthermore, <span class="formula">D</span> must have an inverse because it is element of a field: <span class="formula">DD<sup>-1</sup> = 1</span>.&#160; From that follows that <span class="formula">0 = p ACD<sup>-1</sup> =</span> <span class="formula">qr ACD<sup>-1</sup> =</span> <span class="formula">qA rC D<sup>-1</sup> =</span> <span class="formula">B DD<sup>-1</sup> =</span> <span class="formula">B <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> 0</span>, which is a contradition.Because the cardinality of the Galois field plays an important role we will assign a special character for it.&#160; In the literature often the letter <span class="formula">q</span> is used.&#160; Let therefore <span class="formula">q = 2<sup>m</sup></span> from now on.<h3>Elliptic curves, solutions, points and cardinality</h3>
<em>Every</em> elliptic curve (for any <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span>) of the form <span class="formula">x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + b = y<sup>2</sup> + xy</span> over <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/></span>, will have solutions.&#160; The question is: how many solutions?&#160; How many points <span class="formula">(x,y)</span> will exist, on a given curve?&#160;In an artificial way, it is possible to define a binary operator that assigns a third point on the curve to a combination of two other points.&#160; It is needed to add one artificial point, that is <em>not</em> a solution of the curve, if we want to make the complete set of points an <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AbelianGroup.html">Abelian Group</a>.An Abelian group is a group of elements with a binary operator that is commutative.&#160; For example, let <span class="formula">p</span>, <span class="formula">r</span> and <span class="formula">s</span> be points on the curve and <span class="formula">(p, r) <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\rightarrow$" src="form_1036_67.png"/> s</span> then also <span class="formula">(r, p) <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\rightarrow$" src="form_1036_67.png"/> s</span> (commutation axioma).&#160; The extra point that is not a solution of the curve, is the <em>identity</em> (if we denote this element with an <span class="formula">e</span>, then <span class="formula">(p, e) <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\rightarrow$" src="form_1036_67.png"/> p</span> for every point <span class="formula">p</span> on the curve).&#160; This point is also called "the point at infinity" because it would make sense to think of it like that when constructing the binary operator in a <a href="http://www.certicom.com/index.php?action=ecc_tutorial,ecc_tut_2_1">graphical</a> way over the field of real numbers <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{R}$" src="form_1036_211.png" width="10" height="10"/> (as opposed to over <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/></span>).&#160;The artificial way in which this binary operator is constructed is <em>not</em> relevant once we know the <a href="group__theory__cyclic.html">structure</a> of the (finite and commutative) group.&#160; Those are <a href="http://www.certicom.com/index.php?action=ecc_tutorial,ecc_tut_4_2">implementation details</a> that were only relevant while writing the library and during the analysis of a curve to derive its structure in another way than by brute force determining the <a class="el" href="group__theory__cyclic.html#orderofpoint">order</a> of its points.&#160; The C++ library overloads <code>operator+</code> for the binary operator of the Abelian group of points.&#160; The <em>identity</em> element is therefore refered to as <em>zero</em> in the source code.&#160; It is <a href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;name=Identity">common</a> to use the additive operator for an Abelian group, but we might as well have used <code>operator*</code>, or any other binary operator.<a class="anchor" id="eccardinality"></a>Just as is the case with Galois fields, the <em>number</em> of elements (<b>number of points</b> on the curve (including the zero), or solutions of the curve (combined with the additive identity); also called the <b>order</b> of the curve E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>), or #E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>), and equal to the <b>cardinality</b> (or even 'power' in older books) of the Abelian group formed by those points) is a measure for the characteristics of the Abelian group formed by these points - and therefore its <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/EllipticCurveDiscreteLogarithmProblem.html">security for cryptographic purposes</a>. Below we will talk about 'the cardinality of a curve' instead of 'the order of a curve', so that there can be less confusion about the meaning of the word 'order', which we will frequently use for <a class="el" href="group__theory__cyclic.html#orderofpoint">the order of a point</a>.From now on we will speak about <em>points</em> instead of solutions, but it means the same.&#160; However, if we speak about points than we include the 'point at infinity', the additive identity, the zero.&#160; This just makes most sense because then 'the number of points on a curve' is equal to the cardinality of the finite Abelian group formed by the points.&#160; In other words, when we speak about 'the number of ...' then we always include the additive identity, except perhaps when we specifically talk about 'the number of solutions' (of an equation).<h3>Adding or multiplying points?</h3>
As is said, it is common to use <em>addition</em> as binary operator for an Abelian group: <span class="formula">(G,+)</span>.&#160; Most theory about elliptic curves as well as the interface of libecc will use the <span class="formula">+</span> sign to denote the binary operator.&#160;Using multiplication or addition as binary group operator is just a semantic issue.&#160; When using multiplication as binary operator then it becomes clear why the difficult-to-solve mathematical problem, on which elliptic curve cryptography is based, is called the Discrete Logarithmic Problem.&#160; The problem refered to here is solving <span class="formula">n</span> from the equation <span class="formula">p * p * p * ... * p = p<sup>n</sup> = r</span>, where <span class="formula">p</span> and <span class="formula">r</span> are points on the curve and <span class="formula">n</span> is a large integer.&#160; Equivalent however, when we use addition as the binary group operator, is solving <span class="formula">n</span> from the equation <span class="formula">p + p + p + ... + p = np = r</span>.<h2>Point counting</h2>
The number of solutions to the elliptic curve <span class="formula">x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + b = y<sup>2</sup> + xy</span> over <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/></span> is obviously finite because there are only a finite number of possible values for <span class="formula">x</span> and <span class="formula">y</span>.&#160; Since both <span class="formula">x</span> and <span class="formula">y</span> can each only be one of <span class="formula">q</span> values, the total number of possible combinations <span class="formula">(x,y)</span> is <span class="formula">q<sup>2</sup></span>.&#160; Not all those possibilities will actually be solutions to the curve of course.&#160; If that where the case then we'd have a "2-dimensional" area, black with points.&#160; Instead we have a curve, a line, that runs through this space and we merely expect to have a "1-dimensional" number of points on that curve, of the order of <span class="formula">q</span> plus or minus some variation.In fact, we can set a much stricter interval for the number of points on the curve.&#160; After all, the maximum number of possible solutions is two for each possible value of <span class="formula">x</span>.&#160; For any given <span class="formula">x <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\neq$" src="form_1036_12.png"/> 0</span>, <span class="formula">y</span> is given by a quadractic equation with zero or two solutions.&#160; If <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub></span> is a solution of the quadratic equation <span class="formula">y<sup>2</sup> + xy + c = 0</span> (where <span class="formula">c = x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + b</span>), then <span class="formula">y<sub>2</sub> = y<sub>1</sub> + x</span> is also a solution, what can easily be shown by filling in <span class="formula">y<sub>2</sub></span> into the equation and recalling the fact that <span class="formula">(u + v)<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + v<sup>2</sup></span> and <span class="formula">u<sup>2</sup> + u<sup>2</sup> = 0</span>, for any polynomials <span class="formula">u</span> and <span class="formula">v</span>.The brute force way to count the number of points on a given elliptic curve is by trying to solve the quadratic equation for <span class="formula">y</span>, for every possible value of <span class="formula">x</span>.&#160; <span class="formula">x = 0</span> always has a single solution: <img class="formulaInl" alt="$y=\sqrt{b}$" src="form_1036_266.png" width="40" height="15"/>.&#160; All other values of <span class="formula">x</span> will have either none or two solutions.We can picture this with a "matrix" representation, plotting <span class="formula">x</span> horizontally and <span class="formula">y</span> vertically.&#160; For example, the curve with <span class="formula">m=4</span>, reduction polynomial <span class="formula">t<sup>4</sup> + t + 1 = 0</span>, <span class="formula">a = t<sup>3</sup> + t + 1</span> and <span class="formula">b = t</span> has the following solutions:  <PRE class=pointmatrix>

</PRE> Don't be confused about the decimal numbers 0 through 15, they represent the <span class="formula">2<sup>4</sup></span> polynomials of the Galois field as follows: write them in binary, then bit n represents <span class="formula">t<sup>n</sup></span>.&#160; For example, as said before we always have the point <span class="formula">(0, <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\sqrt{b}$" src="form_1036_22.png"/>)</span>, which is represented by the X in the left most column in this maxtrix.&#160; Apparently <span class="formula"><img class="formulaInl" alt="$\sqrt{b}$" src="form_1036_22.png"/> = 5</span>.&#160; 5 in binary is 101 and therefore represents <span class="formula">t<sup>2</sup> + 1</span>.&#160; If we square this we should get <span class="formula">b = t</span> back; <span class="formula">(t<sup>2</sup> + 1)<sup>2</sup> =</span> <span class="formula">t<sup>4</sup> + 1 = t</span> (the irreducible polynomial of degree 4 used is <span class="formula">t<sup>4</sup> + t + 1</span>, so <span class="formula">t<sup>4</sup> = t + 1</span>).&#160; There is more that we can recognize in this matrix.&#160; As was derived above, every non-zero value of <span class="formula">x</span> has exactly zero or two solutions (the <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="formula">y<sub>2</sub></span> mentioned above).&#160; We clearly see this back in the matrix because each of the 15 columns on the right have either zero or two Xs in them.&#160; Note that the <a href="http://www.certicom.com/index.php?action=ecc_tutorial,ecc_tut_4_2">definition</a> for addition of points tells us that <span class="formula">- (x, y<sub>1</sub>) = (x, y<sub>1</sub> + x)</span>, and thus <span class="formula">(x, y<sub>1</sub>) + (x, y<sub>2</sub>) = 0</span>.&#160;Likewise, every row has zero, one, two or three Xs in them.&#160; This is obviously because those are solutions of the cubic equation <span class="formula">x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + yx + (b + y<sup>2</sup>) = 0</span> (are you getting used yet to fields with characteristics 2 where addition and subtraction are the same?). Finally there is one more property of the <span class="formula">(x, y)</span> solutions that is immediately visible from this matrix: the distance between every two Xs in one column is equal to the value of the <span class="formula">x</span> coordinate.&#160; This is of course a direct result of the fact that <span class="formula">y<sub>1</sub> = y<sub>2</sub> + x</span>.&#160; Please remember that adding two polynomials has to be done 'bitwise' modulo 2, in other words you have to use the XOR operator for addition (and subtraction), like explained in the chapter about polynomials.&#160; The fact that in most cases of this example (namely all of them except <span class="formula">x = 7</span>) you can simply add the decimal representation of the <span class="formula">y</span> values with <span class="formula">x</span> and then subtract 16 from the result if needed (wrap vertically around) is a coincidence!&#160; Examples for which this won't work are <span class="formula">3 + 7 = 4</span> (the column with <span class="formula">x = 7</span>; <span class="formula">(t + 1) + (t<sup>2</sup> + t + 1) = t<sup>2</sup></span>) and <span class="formula">2 + 6 = 4</span> (<span class="formula">t + (t<sup>2</sup> + t) = t<sup>2</sup></span>). Just use exclusive-OR for addition, as has been explained in the <a class="el" href="group__theory__polynomial.html">theory about of the polynomials </a>, and you'll be fine.<a class="anchor" id="bruteforcedata"></a></p><h3>Brute force results</h3>
Brute force counting the points on an elliptic curve is only feasible for very small <span class="formula">q</span>.&#160; We counted the number of points for every possible combination of <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span>, with <span class="formula">m = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9</span> and <span class="formula">10</span>.&#160; The program used to do this can be found in <code>testsuite/point/pointTest.cc</code>.&#160; The graphs below show the results.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
From this brute force data we can already draw some remarkable conclusions.&#160; First of all, it is clear that any isomorphic group of curves comes in batches of <span class="formula">q/2</span> at a time.&#160; Because this amount is of the order of <span class="formula">q</span> we can conclude that there is probably a relationship between <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> that expresses one in the other (so that the total number of 'interesting' curves is reduced from <span class="formula">q<sup>2</sup></span> to about <span class="formula">q</span>), my poor PC is going to like that when we will continue to explore curves of a higher cardinality.Secondly, there is a striking symmetry between curves of a cardinality <span class="formula">#E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>)</span> and <span class="formula">2(q + 1) - #E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>)</span>&#160;: there exists exactly the same number of combinations of <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> for either of the two cardinalities!&#160; We can expect to also see this pairing of cardinality back in a symmetry of <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span>.Actually, since we omitted the value <span class="formula">b = 0</span> (because the resulting equations do not give rise to an Abelian group), there are an even number (<span class="formula">q</span>) of possible values for <span class="formula">a</span> and an odd number (<span class="formula">q - 1</span>) of possible values for <span class="formula">b</span>.&#160; That makes it likely that the batches of isomorphic curves are generated by a variation of <span class="formula">a</span> only, where exactly half of the values of <span class="formula">a</span> lead to isomorphic curves while the other half then might correspond with the cardinality "mirrored" in <span class="formula">q + 1</span>.This hypothesis can easily be checked.&#160; For each combination of <span class="formula">a</span> and <span class="formula">b</span> that results in the a curve with the same structure, we check that there are exactly <span class="formula">q/2</span> different values of <span class="formula">a</span> being used and that each of those values is combined with the same set of values of <span class="formula">b</span>.&#160; Moreover, we check that for the other <span class="formula">q/2</span> values of <span class="formula">a</span> while keeping the value of <span class="formula">b</span> constant, the cardinality changes from <span class="formula">#E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>)</span> into <span class="formula">2(q + 1) - #E( <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mathbb{F}_q$" src="form_1036_1.png"/>)</span>.&#160;This (and more, see below) is tested by the program <code>testsuite/point/plot.cc</code>.&#160; The hypothesis turns out to be correct; at least emperically, for <span class="formula">m <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\leq$" src="form_1036_18.png"/> 10</span>.&#160;We can make this investigation more accessible by making it visible as follows.&#160; The matrix below shows the simplest case, where <span class="formula">m = 3</span> and thus <span class="formula">q = 2<sup>m</sup> = 8</span>. Horizontally all values of <span class="formula">a</span> are plotted (left to right, <span class="formula">0</span> to <span class="formula">7</span>) against vertically all values of <span class="formula">b</span> (bottom to top, <span class="formula">1</span> to <span class="formula">7</span>.&#160; The black bar at the bottom corresponds with <span class="formula">b = 0</span> for which there are no curves).&#160; Again, and this is the last time that I mention it, the convention was used that each bit of these values represent a coefficient of the polynomial field; for example, a value of 6 corresponds to <span class="formula">t<sup>2</sup> + t</span> etc.&#160; As such, each of the 56 little squares corresponds to one possible curve over <span class="formula">F<sub>2<sup>3</sup></sub></span>.&#160; Furthermore, each different structure of the Abelian groups that these curves give rise to is given a different color.

<P>And indeed we see the following properties:

<LI>Those two colors correspond to structures with 'opposite' cardinality

There is <em>another</em> symmetry that we see now, which goes behond the hypothesis that I deduced from the point counting data.&#160; It shows that the structure in <span class="formula">a</span> (the pattern of the two colors per row) is even the same for <em>different</em> structures!&#160; This means that the structure of <span class="formula">a</span> is <em>entirely</em> independent of <span class="formula">b</span> and only a function of <span class="formula">m</span>.&#160; The data below for larger <span class="formula">m</span> (and the program <code>testsuite/point/plot.cc</code>) confirms this.The question that now arrises is of course: how is this structure of <span class="formula">a</span> depending on <span class="formula">m</span>?&#160; A first guess, from the above matrix with <span class="formula">m = 3</span> could be that the color alternates when we add <span class="formula">1</span> (meaning that the bit that corresponds to <span class="formula">1</span>, and that bit only, determines the structure of the curve (apart from the value of <span class="formula">b</span> of course).&#160; However, that turns out to be a bit too simple as can already been seen from the data with <span class="formula">m = 4</span>:

Then perhaps the cardinality depends on a single bit of <span class="formula">a</span>?&#160; No, also not, as is shown by the data of <span class="formula">m = 5</span>:
