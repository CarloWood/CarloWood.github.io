			<P>This poem was first written for a boy called &quot;Ting&quot;.
			That wasn't his real name, but he liked to be called like that and
			everyone did. He was from Thailand and really touched my heart.
			Unfortunately, he lied to me that he didn't have a boyfriend and
			we broke up after about three weeks when he finally told me
			&quot;because he was falling in love with me too&quot; and he
			didn't want that because &quot;he already had a boyfriend&quot;.
			Of course, the poem was written <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>before</I></SPAN>
			he told me that (over the phone).</P>
			<P CLASS="text-body-indent" STYLE="margin-left: 0.00cm">The
			original poem was slightly different, and personally I like the
			original more.</P>
			<P>Here's the original poem, devoted to Ting:</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">If I could be living thousands of
			years,<BR>and visit all planets, to see their moon.<BR>Stayed
			young forever and shed no tears,<BR>listen to whales, and
			understand their tune;</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.27cm">If I could make music that made
			everyone cry<BR>and birds would be listening when I start to
			sing.<BR>If I could see God - when I finally die,<BR>then instead
			I will be, the boyfriend of Ting.</P>
			<P>In total it took me eight hours to write these eight lines. The
			main reason being that I wanted the rhythm to be perfect (too).
			There should be a short pause after &quot;living&quot;, &quot;forever&quot;,
			&quot;music&quot; and after every comma. A long(er) pause comes
			after &quot;tune&quot;, &quot;cry&quot; and &quot;God&quot;. &quot;The
			boyfriend of Ting&quot; needs to be read a little bit slower then
			the rest, as a conclusion. The melody of this poem is at least as
			important but it's hard to describe that in text. However, note
			that the tone should go down at &quot;years&quot;, &quot;tears&quot;,
			&quot;sing&quot;, &quot;die&quot; and &quot;Ting&quot;, while the
			tone should go up on &quot;<U>liv</U>ing&quot;, &quot;<U>thousands</U>&quot;,
			&quot;<U>all</U>&quot; and &quot;<U>mu</U>sic&quot;. The tone of
			other words also should go up and down but a little less then
			these; if you want then you can try it out until you find what
			sounds right.</P>
			<P>P.S. Note that when I could <I>actually </I>choose between
			seeing God when I die, and having any boy as boyfriend now - then
			I'd like to see God (If the choice was seeing God <I>or</I> being
			with my boyfriend, after we both died, then I'd have second
			thoughts though).</P>
